1
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:23,898
My town called that game "the Squid Game".

2
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,237
It was named so because the game
was played in a squid-like outline.

3
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,240
The rules are simple.

4
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:37,996
Children are divided into two groups,
the offense and the defense.

5
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,543
Once the game starts, the defense
can run around on two feet within bounds,

6
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:48,006
while the offense outside the line
is only allowed to hop on one foot.

7
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,469
Your mom!

8
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:57,891
But if an attacker cuts through the waist
of the squid outpacing the defense,

9
00:00:57,974 --> 00:01:02,979
he or she is given the freedom
to walk freely on two feet.

10
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:09,069
The secret inspector.

11
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:14,949
For whatever reason,
we called that the secret inspector.

12
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:19,788
After preparing for the final battle,

13
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:24,042
the attackers gather
at the entrance of the squid.

14
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:27,504
Go.

15
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,924
In order to win, the attackers

16
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:36,012
must tap the small closed-off
space on the squid's head with their foot.

17
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:42,310
If the defender pushes you
out of the squid's line,

18
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:43,603
you die.

19
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:47,607
That's right. You die.

20
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:05,625
Hooray!

21
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,211
"Hooray."

22
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:12,006
Once you take the winning tap,
you yell out, "Hooray."

23
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:16,845
And, in that moment,
I felt as if I owned the entire world,

24
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,513
exhilarated.

25
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:40,493
EPISODE 1
RED LIGHT, GREEN LIGHT

26
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,002
What's this? Is it for me?

27
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:54,424
Do you remember that
it's Ga-yeong's birthday today?

28
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:58,636
Yes, I do.

29
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,766
Don't forget and go buy her dinner later.

30
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:07,020
You can't eat anything nice
with this these days.

31
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,565
Ga-yeong loves fried chicken, you know.

32
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,234
Go buy her some fried chicken.

33
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,612
I can't just get her chicken.

34
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,572
I should get her a birthday gift.

35
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:19,198
Give me a little more.

36
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:20,950
I got no money.

37
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:23,202
What are you talking about?

38
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,622
I gave you all the money I made
as a chauffeur.

39
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:28,041
Goodness, that petty change?

40
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:31,920
Hey, that's not even enough to pay off
the monthly interest for your loan.

41
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:35,298
We can't pay it off
by living like this anyway,

42
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:36,925
so let's use some when we have to.

43
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:39,886
Goodness.

44
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:48,770
And will you please stop doing that?

45
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:51,522
Soak the dishes in water
after you're done.

46
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,945
You always say your back is in pain,
and you don't even make much!

47
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:06,537
Let's see…

48
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:25,306
DAEHAN BANK

49
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,517
ENTER YOUR PIN

50
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:30,853
INCORRECT PIN

51
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,146
My birthday should be it.

52
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,524
She changed the pin.

53
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:37,110
Your mom finally disowned you.

54
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:39,737
Darn it.

55
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:42,782
INCORRECT PIN

56
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,660
Darn it.
What did that old woman change it to?

57
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:47,161
Try her birthday or something.

58
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:48,663
Her birthday?

59
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,415
Mom's birthday…

60
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,334
You don't know your mom's birthday?

61
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,460
You ungrateful bastard!

62
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:57,088
Piss off, moron! I know!

63
00:04:57,171 --> 00:05:00,675
She celebrates by the lunar calendar,
so it changes every year.

64
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:02,218
Idiot. You don't know anything…

65
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,511
Try the lunar date then.

66
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:05,930
Damn it.

67
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,434
God damn it!

68
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,145
Darn it.

69
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,605
Hey. Watch it.

70
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:17,066
The card will be blocked
if you get it wrong again.

71
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,860
Think hard. Got anything else?

72
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:33,624
Checking-- Please press the amount
you would like to withdraw.

73
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,210
What was it? What did you use?

74
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:37,670
Today. My daughter's birthday.

75
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:41,424
Man, the old woman cares
for her granddaughter more than me.

76
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,675
My gosh.

77
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,721
No. 9 Triple Line is in second.
No. 6 Dry Thunder is in third.

78
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,556
No. 3 Jack Prince is in fourth.

79
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,391
And the gap with the lead is widening.

80
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,852
Out of the straight course
and into the turn,

81
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:55,521
-Yes, that's it. Number nine!
-Whip it! Whip!

82
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,857
-No. 3 Jack Prince is accelerating
-Whip! Whip!

83
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,693
-and catching up to No. 9 Triple Line.
-Let's go! Come on!

84
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:04,238
-No. 4 Hwarang is not giving up his place.
-Whip it! Run!

85
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:07,116
-No. 4 Hwarang crosses the finish line.
-No, no!

86
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,743
Damn it!

87
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,871
You said number nine would definitely win!

88
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,083
That stupid idiot.

89
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:19,128
How could you lose
with such a great horse?

90
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:30,807
Betting for the tenth race
is about to end.

91
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:33,643
-I repeat.
-Hurry it up, will you?

92
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,604
Betting for the tenth race
is about to end.

93
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:38,523
Hey.

94
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,444
-What are you--
-Will you just leave me the heck alone?

95
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,154
I'm trying to think!

96
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:56,916
All right.

97
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:03,089
No. 9 Baekil Legend
is placed right in the middle.

98
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:04,715
-No. 6 Thunderflash is quickly
-Okay.

99
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,175
-catching up to the frontrunners,
-Good, keep going.

100
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,969
-but the gap is still wide.
-Run!

101
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:11,013
-They're heading into the curve again.
-Okay. Turn.

102
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,141
-No. 7 Golden Bullet and No. 8 Mad Dash.
-Yes, turn.

103
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:16,018
-They're going full speed.
-Stick to them! Outside!

104
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,479
But, wait! Wrapping around the outside…

105
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,606
-It's No. 6 Thunderflash!
-Yes!

106
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,483
-And he continues to gain ground!
-Six and eight, go!

107
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,485
-The gap is closing!
-Whip! Whip it!

108
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:27,321
-No. 6 has taken the second-place spot,
-Go! Go!

109
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:28,948
-and he's not stopping there.
-Go! Go!

110
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:32,034
-He's taken the lead!
-Go! Go!

111
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,912
-No. 6 Thunderflash brings it home!
-Yes!

112
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,876
Come to me! Six and eight!

113
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,127
I got it!

114
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,504
-Where did six come from?
-Man, seriously!

115
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:46,591
What did I say?
I said it's my daughter's birthday today!

116
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,551
June 8. So, 6 and 8!

117
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,723
Here's 4,560,000 won.

118
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:54,807
Thank you.

119
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:58,186
Here.

120
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,770
Buy yourself a cup of Americano.

121
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:00,771
What about me?

122
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,191
-My mom's money pulled through!
-Wait for me, buddy!

123
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,108
Where's the ATM?

124
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,527
OFF TRACK BETTING

125
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:12,950
Daddy will pick you up
in front of your academy.

126
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:18,581
What? Fried chicken?

127
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,250
Hey, feel free to choose
something more expensive.

128
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,503
Write down everything you want to eat.

129
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,213
No.

130
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,049
Don't write it down during class.

131
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:29,634
Do it during break time. Okay?

132
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,637
All right. Seven o'clock.

133
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,598
Guess what I'll get you for your birthday.

134
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,391
You can look forward to it.

135
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:38,768
You'll be surprised…

136
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:42,104
Hey, Gi-hun!

137
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,147
Hey!

138
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,483
Long time no see!

139
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:49,111
Hey, Ga-yeong. I love you, too.

140
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,697
-What?
-Hey, get him!

141
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,452
Excuse me. Coming through!

142
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:05,002
I'm sorry. Kid, are you okay?

143
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,671
Goodness.

144
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,716
-I'm sorry.
-Grab him!

145
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,969
Hey! Stop right there!

146
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:18,349
Wait. One second. Let me stand up.

147
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:21,727
I have money. I really do.

148
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,229
Do you?

149
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,023
Then why did you run?

150
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,275
That's because…

151
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:32,238
I wanted to pay you all at once
to save you the trouble.

152
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:36,284
Goodness, what a trooper.

153
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,244
So? How much do you have?

154
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,620
Four million.

155
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:43,791
Please take this for now,
and I'll pay the rest next month…

156
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,300
Kid, are you okay?

157
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,679
Let me see.

158
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,514
Come on, let me see.

159
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,433
Goodness.

160
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,898
That's sweet.

161
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:11,027
You must've had lots of good food
with my money.

162
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,862
I had money on me.

163
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:17,158
Just now, six and eight…
Six and eight won earlier, so I had money.

164
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:18,200
Hey.

165
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:28,085
Do you know why
it's so easy to get nosebleeds?

166
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,423
Because there are
a lot of capillary vessels in there.

167
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:35,009
No, please. Please don't kill me.

168
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:36,052
Your blood was tasty.

169
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:39,597
Maybe I'll take a bowl
and cook up some blood soup tonight.

170
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,098
I'll pay you back.

171
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:45,353
I really mean it. I'll pay up.

172
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,438
Man, you punk.

173
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,940
Don't cry. You're making me feel bad.

174
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:52,109
How did he know I was a softie?

175
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:55,404
Hey.

176
00:10:58,282 --> 00:10:59,784
Now, wipe your tears

177
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:02,161
and stamp your fingerprint.

178
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:07,291
If you don't pay up by next month,
I'm taking one of your kidneys here

179
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,086
and one of these eyes instead.

180
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,214
You don't like it?

181
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:16,342
That's not it. Yes, I understand.

182
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,178
-Here.
-Okay.

183
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:21,013
Well, I need an ink pad.

184
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,103
There it is. All-natural ink pad.

185
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:28,562
Sorry?

186
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,481
Right, yes.

187
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,651
Yes, right there. Good.

188
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:35,820
DISCLAIMER OF PHYSICAL RIGHTS

189
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:38,531
Great job.

190
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:42,201
You have a month. Take care of yourself.

191
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,829
Wait, sir.

192
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,874
Well, I'm sorry but…

193
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,711
may I borrow 10,000 won?

194
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:57,800
Seriously, you little…

195
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,053
WINDOW CLOSED

196
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:04,557
Excuse me.

197
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,309
I'm sorry,

198
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,064
could I have that 10,000 won back?

199
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:17,403
THE FUN DOESN'T END, CRANE GAME

200
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,120
Darn it.

201
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,371
Come on!

202
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,635
Okay. That's it.

203
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:43,679
Damn!

204
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:50,144
God damn it!

205
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:51,687
Sir,

206
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,565
you keep failing
because you pick without thinking.

207
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:56,775
Are you any good?

208
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:12,958
That's it. Good.

209
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:14,960
Yes, that's it.

210
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:26,347
Great job! Great work!

211
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,316
This?

212
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:41,445
I was bitten by a huge mosquito.

213
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:45,282
Mosquitoes are really mean these days.

214
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:51,330
Dad, you're free to get into fights,

215
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,457
but don't get beaten up.

216
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:00,089
I'm sorry, sweetie.

217
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:04,426
I wanted to buy you
something more delicious.

218
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,427
It's okay.

219
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:09,473
I went to a steakhouse
with Mom and my stepdad.

220
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:13,811
You had steak?

221
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:17,481
I see.

222
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:22,653
But I think tteokbokki is way better.

223
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:29,243
Mom won't let me have this
saying it's junk food.

224
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,038
Eat up.

225
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,040
Right!

226
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:39,670
Ga-yeong, I got you a birthday present.

227
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,687
Did you know there are a lot of women
in the army these days?

228
00:14:57,313 --> 00:15:01,901
There won't be any discrimination
between men and women in your future.

229
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,194
You need to get used to these things.

230
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,369
It's even has a light.

231
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:17,082
Hey, it looks like the real deal,
doesn't it?

232
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:23,839
But I think you'll get in trouble again
if Mom sees this.

233
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,090
Is that so?

234
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,053
Then I'll keep this until you get older.

235
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,846
But don't use that to smoke.

236
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,264
I quit smoking.

237
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,065
All right.

238
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:44,026
I'll be sure to quit smoking.

239
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:47,655
And on your next birthday,
I'll get you a really awesome present.

240
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:49,865
I promise, Ga-yeong.

241
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,201
Next year?

242
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,994
Think of your birthday last year.

243
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,496
It came around quickly, right?

244
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,581
The next one will come around
in a flash too.

245
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,458
Dad.

246
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:02,211
Yes? What is it?

247
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:06,715
Never mind.

248
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:12,262
All right. Have some more tteokbokki.

249
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,474
Excuse me,
we'll have 1,000 won's worth more.

250
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,559
Mix in a lot of fish cake.

251
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:36,370
Why did you bring her back so late?
She's dressed lightly.

252
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,206
She got sleepy, so I had to carry her.

253
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,917
We're only ten minutes late.

254
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,752
I said I'd drive to pick her up.

255
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,046
That's enough. It's her birthday.

256
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,215
Mom.

257
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:50,342
-There, there.
-Ga-yeong, come down.

258
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:53,095
I'll carry her to the elevator.

259
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,471
She'll catch a bad habit.

260
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:55,597
Mom…

261
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,183
-Ga-yeong, come down.
-My gosh. Seriously.

262
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,561
Come on. Let's go.

263
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,111
Bye, Dad.

264
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,738
Go on in.

265
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,460
Wait a minute! Wait…

266
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,158
Sir.

267
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:58,911
Do you have a minute?

268
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,082
I don't believe in Jesus.

269
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,709
It's not that.

270
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,046
I'd like to give you a great opportunity--

271
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:19,848
I come from a Buddhist household,
so stop bothering me and get lost.

272
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:23,644
Sir.

273
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,688
Would you like to play a game with me?

274
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,234
What are you?

275
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,861
A solicitor?

276
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,115
You people have
all kinds of sales tactics.

277
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,868
I can see how unfortunate
your situation is,

278
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,120
but I have no time to…

279
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:48,460
Sir, you've played ddakji before,
haven't you?

280
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:53,090
Play ddakji with me. Each time you win,

281
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:54,925
I will give you 100,000 won.

282
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,852
Wait, so if I flip your ddakji over,

283
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,646
you'll give me 100,000 won?

284
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:11,316
However, each time I win,
you must give me 100,000 won.

285
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,532
I'll let you go first.

286
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:26,582
I'm in a really foul mood today.

287
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:31,420
If this is some kind of scam,
I'm going to kill you today.

288
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,840
I'll go first, then.

289
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,178
Which color do you want?

290
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,337
Do you not have any money?

291
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,255
Money…

292
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,134
You can use your body to pay up.

293
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:20,844
My body?

294
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,097
What's with you?

295
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,350
I'll take off 100,000 won per slap.

296
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:32,773
One more round.

297
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,191
The doors are opening.

298
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:38,028
Another round!

299
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,513
I won! See that?

300
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:48,932
Did you see that? I won!

301
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:52,019
Come here. Get your face over here.

302
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,063
Let go of this, you jerk.

303
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:58,108
Here's your 100,000 won.

304
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,779
Congratulations.

305
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:09,578
Right.

306
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:11,997
I get 100,000 won.

307
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:22,215
Sir.

308
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,843
You can make a lot
by playing such games for a few days.

309
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,971
Would you like to give it a try?

310
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:30,307
Hey, man.

311
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:32,851
Is this some sort of new pyramid scheme?

312
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:35,979
But you got the wrong man.

313
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,023
I'm not that naive.

314
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,197
Mr. Seong Gi-hun.

315
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:49,910
You signed a disclaimer
of physical rights today, didn't you?

316
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,539
Name, Seong Gi-hun. 47 years old.

317

320

323
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:12,516
As of now,
you owe 160 million won to loan sharks

324
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:15,185
and 255 million won to the bank.

325
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:20,315
Who are you?

326
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,944
How dare you run a background check on me?

327
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:31,076
We don't have many spots left.

328
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,164
Give me a call.

329
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,989
All right. Whatever.

330
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:15,120
Thirsty in the middle of the night
I open the fridge

331
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:16,538
Did you have a drink today?

332
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,373
No.

333
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,710
I haven't had a drop of alcohol,
but I feel tipsy.

334
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,630
Because I made money today!

335
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:30,218
Gi-hun, do you still gamble?

336
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,179
I didn't gamble.

337
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:34,931
I earned this money fair and square.

338
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,516
What's with your face by the way?

339
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,436
-Do you get into fights now?
-Hey, forget it.

340
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:43,064
I wonder what Sang-woo is up to now.
How's he doing at work?

341
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,566
He's always busy.

342
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,152
He's abroad right now on a business trip.

343
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:49,529
That ungrateful punk.

344
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:52,115
Tell him to call me when he comes home.

345
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:53,867
You remember, right?

346
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,244
He got into Seoul National University
thanks to me.

347
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,788
I used to take him to school
when we were kids.

348
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:02,083
He got into college and got a job
because of me,

349
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,169
but he's never bought me a drink.

350
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:07,380
Stop talking nonsense.
Take this and go home.

351
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:09,132
Don't go to a bar. Go straight home.

352
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:11,551
Here. Keep the change.

353
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:19,476
Thirsty in the middle of the night
I open the fridge

354
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,519
That's worth 12,000 won, you rascal.

355
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:29,152
A salted mackerel
In the corner of the room

356
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,374
Are you hungry? Are you?

357
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,668
Here.

358
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:46,836
Eat this.

359
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:49,923
You have to finish it, okay?

360
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:52,717
I bought that with the money I made
by getting slapped.

361
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:03,520
I am quite the fool

362
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:07,857
Just looking at my mom pleases me

363
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:14,281
Here. It's an allowance.

364
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:17,534
Take it.

365
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:18,451
Goodness.

366
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,538
Did you gamble again?

367
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:23,915
I didn't.

368
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:27,460
Then, what happened to your face?

369
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,505
Why aren't you answering?

370
00:26:30,588 --> 00:26:32,299
It's nothing like that!

371
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:37,178
Wait, did you steal this from someone?

372
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,890
I didn't gamble or steal.

373
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:46,229
I worked my hands, face, and body off
to earn this money.

374
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,064
My gosh.

375
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:58,992
Did you buy fried chicken for Ga-yeong?

376
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,078
I bought her dinner

377
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:05,290
and a birthday present before I came home.

378
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:08,168
Did she tell you anything?

379
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:10,920
Tell me what?

380
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:16,176
Ga-yeong, her mother, and her stepdad

381
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:20,347
are all moving to the US next year.

382
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:26,436
And on your next birthday,
I'll get you a really awesome present.

383
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:28,396
I promise, Ga-yeong.

384
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,066
Next year?

385
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:33,568
The US?

386
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,028
Yes.

387
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:39,032
Her stepdad got a new job in the US,

388
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:42,994
so the entire family is moving there.

389
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,458
I see.

390
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:53,505
How can you eat anything right now?

391
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,674
You need to get your daughter back.

392
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,261
How am I going to do that?

393
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:05,183
That was settled
when we signed the divorce papers.

394
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:14,275
The young man upstairs
who's well-versed in the law said

395
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:20,907
if the father can prove
he can financially support his child,

396
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:24,285
he can take the child back.

397
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:29,582
If she moves to the US,

398
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,376
she'll forget how to speak Korean,

399
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:34,254
then it'll be hard for you two
to talk to each other.

400
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:38,091
You'll become a stranger to her for good.

401
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:41,761
Are you sure

402
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,391
you can live without seeing her?

403
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,153
Hello.

404
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:42,197
I'm…

405
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:45,450
the guy who got
your business card this afternoon.

406
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:47,786
Do you wish to participate in the game?

407
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:51,915
If you wish to participate,
please state your name and birthdate.

408
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:08,306
Gosh.

409
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,029
Mr. Seong Gi-hun?

410
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,699
Yes.

411
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:27,742
The password?

412
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:34,374
Red light, green light.

413
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,850
I guess everyone is…

414
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:53,977
tired.

415
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,689
How long will it take

416
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:00,275
to get to the game venue?

417
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:31,681
What?

418
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:43,836
Fifty, fifty-two…

419
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:47,006
fifty-five, fifty-six…

420
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,007
Sir.

421
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:50,385
What are you doing?

422
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,929
Don't talk to me. You're distracting me.

423
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:55,223
Fifty… what was it?

424
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:01,020
Are you counting the number of people?

425
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:03,940
Yes, so stop talking to me.

426
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:06,526
And then… What?

427
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:08,653
Wait.

428
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:10,863
Where was I?

429
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:15,451
Sir, look over there.
There are 456 people here.

430
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:19,247
Wait, you were the first to get here.

431
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,290
And I'm… What?

432
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:23,626
I'm last.

433
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,505
I know that too.

434
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:30,216
I'm just counting the numbers.

435
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:33,052
My doctor said counting numbers

436
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:35,638
is good for preventing dementia.

437
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:38,474
Why did you come here when you're
old enough to worry about dementia?

438
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:41,769
You should be eating meals
your daughter-in-law makes for you,

439
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:44,981
then lying down on the warm floor
watching your grandkids acting cute.

440
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:47,692
What about your parents?

441
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:51,362
Do they get to eat fresh-cooked meals
their daughter-in-law makes for them?

442
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:58,536
You see, my days are numbered.

443
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,038
Sorry?

444
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:02,373
My doctor said

445
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:06,377
there's a lump in my head.

446
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:08,963
A lump?

447
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,173
Brain tumor.

448
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,094
You bitch!

449
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,475
Hey!

450
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:21,934
Geez.

451
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:24,020
I can't believe I've run into you here.

452
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:27,315
Look at those eyes.
Your temper hasn't changed.

453
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,025
Then again,

454
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:33,571
you're not the type
to back down after a few blows.

455
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:37,366
I fed you, put a roof over your head,
even taught you my skills,

456
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,368
but you backstab me?

457
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:42,163
You already took more from me
than what I owe you.

458
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:45,416
If that's true, why did you run away?

459
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,586
I didn't run away.
I just went independent.

460
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,091
"Independent"?

461
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,737
You went independent?
Are you Yu Gwan-sun or what?

462
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:16,280
Go out and wave a flag, then.

463
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,907
Oh, right.

464
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:21,744
You're from the North,
so wave the North Korean flag.

465
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:26,415
Come here.

466
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,084
That scar on your neck.

467
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:29,669
Yes, it's you, the pickpocket!

468
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:32,213
Give me my money back. Where's my money?

469
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:33,548
Give it back!

470
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,968
What the hell?

471
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,512
Who are you?

472
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:42,181
Who the hell are you?

473
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,600
Me? Well…

474
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,979
I'm Seong Gi-hun from Ssangmun-dong.

475
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:49,105
Hey, Mr. Ssangmun-dong.

476
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:50,273
Yes?

477
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:52,525
I'm not done with this wench.

478
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:56,154
I'm sorry, but I also have
something urgent to discuss

479
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:57,530
with this sister over here.

480
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,157
You bastard.

481
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,576
What's your relation with her?

482
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,077
My gosh.

483
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,204
Then what's your relation with her?

484
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:09,208
You obviously look like a thug
who preys on girls like her.

485
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:11,460
Did you tell her to steal my money?

486
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:13,504
-You son of a bitch!
-Wait!

487
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,214
This thug is trying to kill me!

488
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,426
Someone get over here! We need help!

489
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,094
There they are.

490
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,221
Over here! We got a thug and a pickpocket.

491
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:24,056
A thug and a pickpocket.

492
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:53,211
I would like to extend
a hearty welcome to you all.

493
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:57,590
Everyone here will participate
in six different games over six days.

494
00:36:57,673 --> 00:37:02,553
Those who win all six games
will get a handsome cash prize.

495
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,014
How are we supposed to believe you?

496
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:08,184
You suddenly put us to sleep,
take our phones and wallets away,

497
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:10,144
then bring us to this mysterious place.

498
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:13,481
Now you show up saying you'll pay us
handsomely for playing a few games?

499
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,399
Do you expect us to believe that?

500
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,652
We reluctantly took those measures

501
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:21,322
to maintain our confidentiality
bringing you here.

502
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:24,242
We'll return everything
once the games are over.

503
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:28,329
How come you are wearing those masks?

504
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:30,414
We do not disclose the faces

505
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:33,501
and personal information of our staff
to the participants.

506
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:37,713
It's a measure we take
for the fairness of games and privacy.

507
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:40,758
-Please understand.
-I don't trust a word you just said.

508
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:43,803
You lured, kidnapped, and locked us up.

509
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:47,014
You make all kinds of excuses
to keep yourself hidden

510
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,557
after all those illegal actions.

511
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:52,603
Give us one good reason
why we should trust you.

512
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:54,855
Player 218, Cho Sang-woo.

513
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,150
Age, 46.

514
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:00,903
Former team leader
of Team Two at Joy Investments.

515
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:02,780
Siphoned money from his clients,

516
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:06,325
then invested in derivatives
and futures options with it and failed.

517
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:09,036
Current loss, 650 million won.

518
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,247
Player 107, Kim Mi-ok,
540 million won in debt.

519
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,416
Player 118, Oh Yeong-uk,
1.02 billion won in debt.

520
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:16,252
Player 322, Jung Min-tae,
880 million won in debt.

521
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,754
Player 119, No Sang-hun,
1.39 billion won in debt.

522
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:21,674
Player 369, Park Ju-un,
900 million won in debt.

523
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:24,927
All of you in this room

524
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:30,057
are living on the edge,
with debts you just can't pay off.

525
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:35,021
When we first went to see you,
none of you trusted us.

526
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:38,190
But as you know, we played a game

527
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:40,818
and gave you money as promised.

528
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:42,903
So everyone here trusted us

529
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:48,284
and volunteered to participate in
this game of your own free will.

530
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:51,996
I'll give you one last chance to choose.

531
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:59,211
Will you go back to living your lousy life
being chased by your creditors?

532
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:04,133
Or will you grab the last opportunity
we're offering here?

533
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:10,973
What kind of games are we playing?

534
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:12,933
In order to play fair,

535
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,561
we cannot disclose any information
on the games ahead of time.

536
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:17,229
Excuse me.

537
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:20,483
Just how much is the prize money?

538
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:33,913
Your prize money will be accumulated
in the piggy bank after every game.

539
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:41,420
We will disclose the amount to everyone
after the first game is over.

540
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:46,175
If you do not wish to participate,
please let us know now.

541
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:18,874

546
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:51,490
SIGNATURE, SEONG GI-HUN

547
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:57,288
The game is about to begin.

548
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:02,710
All players, follow the staff's
instructions and proceed to the game hall.

549
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:09,675
Hey, look over there.

550
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:12,970
Damn, this place is freaking huge.

551
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,557
Please look into the camera.

552
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:25,274
Please look into the camera.

553
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:29,945
Darn it.

554
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:32,156
Move, idiot.

555
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:39,246
Please look into the camera.

556
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:57,700
Verified.

557
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:14,466
Hey, Sang-woo!

558
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:18,637
It is you, Sang-woo.

559
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:21,765
What happened? Why are you here?

560
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,602
I went to your mom's store recently,

561
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:26,895
and she said you were abroad
on a business trip.

562
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:29,857
And is what he said true?

563
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:31,650
You're in debt?

564
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:34,278
Cho Sang-woo who attends SNU,
the pride of Ssangmun-dong?

565
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:36,614
Welcome to the first game.

566
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:37,573
Let's talk later.

567
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:42,578
All players,
please wait a moment on the field.

568
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:44,538
Let me repeat.

569
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:49,084
All players,
please wait a moment on the field.

570
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:47,434
-Hey.
-What?

571
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,812
Look over there. What is that?

572
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:51,146
It looks really freaky.

573
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,315
Damn, that thing has a freaking huge head.

574
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:59,154
The first game is Red Light, Green Light.

575
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:07,621
You can move forward while
"it" shouts out, "Green Light, Red Light"

576
00:45:07,704 --> 00:45:11,750
If your movement is detected afterward,
you will be eliminated.

577
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:13,836
Red Light, Green Light?

578
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:17,339
The game we played as kids?

579
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:19,758
-Let me repeat.
-I think so.

580
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:23,178
-Is this a fucking joke?
-You can move forward

581
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:24,638
-Are they serious?
-while "it" shouts out,

582
00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:26,890
-Want to bet who finishes first?
-"Green Light, Red Light."

583
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:29,935
If your movement is detected afterward,
you will be eliminated.

584
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:30,894
A million won.

585
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:32,563
Deal?

586
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:34,690
Man, damn it.

587
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:35,607
Deal.

588
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:40,779
Those who cross the finish line
without getting caught in five minutes

589
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:42,322
pass this round.

590
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:44,658
Then let the game begin.

591
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:52,166
Green Light, Red Light.

592
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:58,714
Player 324. Eliminated.

593
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:00,883
That idiot got caught.

594
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:06,930
What…

595
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:09,308
was that sound?

596
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:21,987
Green Light, Red Light.

597
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:27,618
Hey, you're eliminated, you idiot.

598
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:30,370
Stop putting on a show and get up.

599
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,326
Let me repeat.

600
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:57,457
You can move forward while
"it" shouts out, "Green Light, Red Light."

601
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:03,547
If your movement is detected afterward,
you will be eliminated.

602
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,803
Let me repeat.

603
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:15,559
You can move forward while
"it" shouts out, "Green Light, Red Light."

604
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:20,689
If your movement is detected afterward,
you will be eliminated.

605
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:23,942
Let the game begin.

606
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:29,781
Green Light, Red Light.

607
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:43,086
Green Light, Red Light.

608
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:51,219
Green Light, Red Light.

609
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:59,102
Green Light, Red Light.

610
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:06,193
Gi-hun, don't turn your head. Just listen.

611
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,904
You'll die if you stay like that.

612
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,531
I think that doll is a motion sensor.

613
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:15,243
You won't be caught
if you hide behind someone.

614
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:21,041
Green Light, Red Light.

615
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:30,550
There's no time.

616
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:39,726
Green Light, Red Light.

617
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:52,906
Green Light, Red Light.

618
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:03,458
Green Light, Red Light.

619
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:08,296
Who is that behind me all along?

620
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:10,757
The one who backstabbed you.

621
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:13,552
You bitch.

622
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:17,264
Want me to stab you in the back again?

623
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:18,432
No, don't.

624
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:20,100
Please.

625
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:21,852
Stop trembling, moron.

626
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:23,353
You'll die if you get caught.

627
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:25,605
Green Light, Red Light.

628
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:37,242
Green Light, Red Light.

629
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:41,663
Please, help me. Please.

630
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:42,998
Let me go.

631
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:46,293
Please…

632
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:51,590
Green Light, Red Light.

633
00:50:58,054 --> 00:51:00,891
Green Light, Red Light.

634
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:12,363
