00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:51,801
EPISODE 9
ONE LUCKY DAY

2
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,846
Player 218 and 456.

3
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:57,682
Welcome to the final game.

4
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:03,563
Before we begin, there will be a coin toss
to decide offense and defense.

5
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:07,275
Please choose triangle or square.

6
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:09,819
Triangle.

7
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,288
It's triangle.

8
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:23,291
Please choose either offense or defense.

9
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:30,006
Offense.

10
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:34,469
Player 456 will play offense.
Player 218 will defend.

11
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:51,236
The sixth and final game
will be Squid Game.

12
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:08,586
Let me explain the rules of Squid Game.

13
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:12,423
One. The attacker needs to
go into the squid drawing,

14
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:17,262
run past the defense, and tap
the squid's head with his foot to win.

15
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:20,932
Two. The defender must push the attacker

16
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:23,893
out of the drawing to win.

17
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,146
Three. If there comes a situation

18
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:29,732
where either one of you
cannot continue playing,

19
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,943
the last one standing wins.

20
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,369
What do you mean…

21
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:44,998
by "cannot continue playing"?

22
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:48,626
It refers to a player's death.

23
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:52,881
Now, let the game begin.

24
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,698
We played this pretty often as kids.

25
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:03,660
Do you remember

26
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,663
what we said when we crossed this?

27
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:07,830
Cut the crap and--

28
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,220
The secret inspector.

29
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,183
We said, "the secret inspector."

30
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,332
Good rain knows the best time to fall.

31
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:02,844
Du Fu.

32
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,394
She was going to die anyway.

33
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,188
I just ended her pain quickly.

34
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,607
Don't give me that bullshit.

35
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,901
She was alive,

36
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:21,821
and she could've been saved.

37
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,990
That's why I killed her.

38
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,284
Because I know how you are.

39
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:30,913
Because you would've given up on playing
just to save her.

40
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:33,791
Was that it?

41
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:37,378
Were you afraid I'd give up?

42
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:38,421
That's right!

43
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:42,216
Because if you two gave up,
it would've been all over!

44
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,510
I'd have to leave here without a penny!

45
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:48,681
If it hadn't been for her,

46
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,935
I would've killed you with this knife.

47
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,276
You…

48
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,489
won't leave here with the money.

49
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,084
You bastard!

50
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,248
Die.

51
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,169
Die!

52
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,270
Do you remember this place?

53
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,565
We played Red Light, Green Light here.

54
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,361
Everyone who stood here back then
is all dead now,

55
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,279
except for you and me.

56
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,034
We've…

57
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,495
come too far to go back.

58
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,826
You killed them.

59
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,079
You killed everyone.

60
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,790
You killed them.

61
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,668
You're the one who killed them.

62
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,430
I'm done.

63
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,815
I want to stop here.

64
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,620
Clause Three of the agreement.

65
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,873
Games may be terminated

66
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,334
if the majority agrees.

67
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,423
If we both give up,

68
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:58,717
the game ends here.

69
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:24,034
Sang-woo.

70
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,455
When we were kids,

71
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,375
we would play just like this,

72
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,796
and our moms would call us in for dinner.

73
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,718
But no one calls us anymore.

74
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,266
Let's go.

75
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:54,940
Let's go home.

76
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:12,791
Gi-hun.

77
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,086
I'm sorry.

78
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:27,890
Sang-woo!

79
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,101
Sang-woo…

80
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:33,687
Gi-hun.

81
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:38,442
No, Sang-woo. Don't talk.

82
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:41,570
-My mom.
-Sang-woo…

83
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,741
My mom…

84
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,826
No. Don't.

85
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:53,290
Sang-woo, no…

86
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:03,801
Sang-woo…

87
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,973
Congratulations on your victory.

88
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,225
It was quite the game.

89
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:55,644
Why?

90
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:02,359
Why do you do this?

91
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,487
You like horseracing, right?

92
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,909
You people are horses.

93
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,369
Horses at a racetrack.

94
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:15,956
It was unexpected.

95
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:19,919
I didn't think you'd run this far.

96
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:23,964
Who are you?

97
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:27,551
Just think of it as a dream.

98
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,764
It wasn't a bad dream for you anyway.

99
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:33,974
Who are you?

100
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,690
Who are you?

101
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:46,487
Who are you?

102
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,742
Who are…

103
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:54,787
Who are you…

104
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,752
Believe in Jesus or go to Hell!

105
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:04,797
You foolish people
who deny the Lord's existence!

106
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,923
Repent!

107
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,968
The day of judgment is upon us!

108
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:12,137
Believe in Jesus or go to Hell!

109
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:16,225
Only the fiery pits of Hell await you!

110
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:19,436
Kneel down before the Lord!

111
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,774
Believe in Jesus or go to Hell!

112
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,913
BELIEVE IN JESUS

113
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:57,599
Believe in Jesus.

114
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:21,165
Checking your IC card information.

115
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,294

ENTER YOUR 4-DIGIT PIN

119
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:56,450
Counting the bills. Please wait a moment.

120
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,535
Please take your cash.

121
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:19,389
BALANCE: 45,599,990,000 WON

122
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,122
Gi-hun.

123
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:53,966
What happened to you?

124
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,346
Did you get drunk and fight again?

125
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:04,768
Wait here.

126
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,992
I packed some mackerel.
Go have it with your mom.

127
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:28,876
She must be sick.
She won't pick up her phone.

128
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:31,628
She hasn't come out to work
for two days now.

129
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,589
I should've stopped by,

130
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,300
but I've been so out of it lately.

131
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:44,641
It's all right.

132
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:47,394
If you have money,
save it and give it to your mother.

133
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:57,821
Gi-hun.

134
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:02,618
Have you

135
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:06,205
heard from Sang-woo…

136
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:08,916
recently?

137
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:15,547
Never mind.

138
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,175
Get going.

139
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:23,657
Mom.

140
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:26,034
I'm home.

141
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:40,299
Mom?

142
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,933
Mom, are you asleep?

143
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:53,103
Mom.

144
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,151
Mom, I'm home.

145
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,197
Mom.

146
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,704
Mom, I'm home.

147
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:17,544
Mom.

148
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:22,507
Open your eyes.

149
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,220
Mom.

150
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,067
Mom, I'm home.

151
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,072
I made some money.

152
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:49,177
1 YEAR LATER

153
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:38,018
One of our staff is a certified barista,

154
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:39,519
and he made it himself.

155
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,105
I'm not sure if it's to your taste.

156
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:44,649
Why did you want to see me?

157
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:48,695
I'm sorry for asking you
to come all the way here.

158
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:51,489
We wanted to send you a car, but--

159
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:52,949
Why did you want to see me?

160
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:55,994
Well, actually…

161
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:02,918
It's been quite a while since
you deposited your money at our bank,

162
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:06,004
but we haven't heard from you.

163
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,301
What is there

164
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,472
for me to say?

165
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:17,224
Pardon?

166
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:21,353
No, that's not what I mean.

167
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:28,068
Your money is now
in a regular savings account,

168
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:31,488
but you get almost no interest
with that account.

169
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:35,158
And our bank recently began

170
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:39,829
a VIP-only consultation service
for our VIPs like you.

171
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:42,540
I wanted to tell you about it
and introduce myself to you.

172
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,502
You must be a busy man, but I wanted to…

173
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:49,089
Goodness. Did I offend you in any way?

174
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,677
May I ask for a favor?

175
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,929
Sure, please do tell.

176
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:01,726
May I borrow 10,000 won?

177
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,229
Sorry?

178
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:09,192
Right, of course. Sure.

179
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:48,982
Excuse me.

180
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,903
Please buy some flowers.

181
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:57,157
Please.

182
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:02,245
These will all end up wilting
if I don't sell them by the end of today.

183
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:10,837
Thank you.

184
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:13,673
Thank you.

185
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,428
Thank you.

186
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:02,097
DECEMBER 24, 11:30 P.M.
SKY BUILDING, 7TH FLOOR

187
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,932
FROM YOUR GGANBU

188
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:57,295
Can you pass me some water?

189
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:06,679
Please.

190
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:30,203
Who…

191
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:34,916
are you?

192
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,136
That man

193
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,389
over there.

194
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,476
He must be drunk.

195
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:57,897
He has been there for hours.

196
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:01,609
He looks like

197
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:04,195
a homeless man.

198
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:05,864
Were…

199
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,077
you behind everything?

200
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,706
He'll soon freeze to death
if he stays out there.

201
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,960
But no one is helping him.

202
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:21,004
Why did you do it?

203
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,925
What would you do?

204
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,218
Answer me!

205
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,555
Why did you do something like that?

206
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:34,017
Would you stop and help

207
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:41,566
that smelly, human piece of trash?

208
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:42,817
Who are you?

209
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,154
Why did you let me live?

210
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:47,739
Play

211
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:50,617
another game with me.

212
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:54,454
If that man…

213
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:58,124
remains there until midnight,

214
00:31:58,917 --> 00:31:59,876
I win.

215
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:02,587
If someone…

216
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,507
helps him before then,

217
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:09,719
you win.

218
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,348
Stop talking nonsense.

219
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:17,727
I can kill you right this instant.

220
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:19,979
If you do that,

221
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:23,608
you'll never get an answer from me.

222
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:27,904
If you play with me,

223
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,031
I'll answer

224
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:32,700
your question.

225
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:05,858
If you lose,

226
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:10,446
I'll kill you with my own hands.

227
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,656
Then,

228
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,076
what will you wager?

229
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,161
Anything.

230
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:22,959
You can take everything from me
if you want anyway.

231
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,015
Who…

232
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:39,475
are you?

233
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:40,810
I…

234
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:44,939
make money by lending it.

235
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,191
How easily do you make money…

236
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:51,779
for you to do something like that?

237
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:53,614
Money.

238
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:56,868
You know what making money is like.

239
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:00,955
Is that something easy?

240
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:03,708
How much…

241
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,295
is the truth?

242
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:10,715
And how much is a lie?

243
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:14,510
Oh Il-nam.

244
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,389
Is that even your real name?

245
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:19,557
Yes.

246
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:21,601
That's my name.

247
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:23,811
Oh Il-nam.

248
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:27,398
And it's also true

249
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:31,986
that there's a tumor inside my head.

250
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:34,864
Long ago,

251
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:38,367
I once lived in a house

252
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:44,082
in an alley just like that one
with my wife and son.

253
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,363
Do you…

254
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:17,949
still

255
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:19,992
trust people?

256
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:23,162
Even after what you've been through?

257
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,623
Why did you want to see me?

258
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,292
I heard

259
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:32,004
you haven't touched your prize money

260
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:35,633
and have gone back
to living your old life.

261
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,348
Is it because you feel guilty?

262
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:49,647
Guilt?

263
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:55,653
I don't think that's for you to say.

264
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:57,029
That money

265
00:35:58,072 --> 00:35:59,824
was the reward you got

266
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:03,161
for your luck and hard work.

267
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:07,498
You have the right to use it.

268
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:09,959
Look at me.

269
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,005
Life is…

270
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:17,550
short.

271
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,189
Why did you do such a thing?

272
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,234
Do you know

273
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:39,822
what someone with no money

274
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:47,121
has in common
with someone with too much money?

275
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:52,877
Living

276
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:55,838
is no fun for them.

277
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,302
If you have too much money,

278
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:07,558
no matter what you buy, eat, or drink,

279
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:13,272
everything gets boring in the end.

280
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,194
At some point,

281
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:23,282
all my clients began
to tell me the same thing.

282
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:31,165
That they had no joy in life anymore.

283
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:36,796
So, we all got together

284
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:40,383
and did some pondering.

285
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:45,346
What can we do

286
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:48,224
to have some fun?

287
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:49,475
"Fun"?

288
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:55,564
You put us through it

289
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:58,567
for fun?

290
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:02,238
It seems like you've forgotten.

291
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:06,200
I never forced anyone

292
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:09,912
to play that game.

293
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:17,586
You also ended up coming back
of your own accord.

294
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:31,517
It looks like

295
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:35,438
you're out of luck now.

296
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:39,233
Do you

297
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:41,777
still

298
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:46,574
have trust in people?

299
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:49,160
Why did you

300
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,371
join the game?

301
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,250
When I was a child,

302
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:00,338
I had so much fun

303
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:04,884
no matter what I did with my friends

304
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:09,347
that I lost track of time.

305
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,392
I wanted

306
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,354
to feel the same feeling

307
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:20,191
one more time before I die.

308
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:26,530
It's not something you can feel
while watching as a spectator.

309
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:30,201
I wanted that feeling.

310
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:32,203
So?

311
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:36,582
Did it feel good?

312
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:38,834
You asked me

313
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:44,965
why I let you live.

314
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:49,553
Because it was fun

315
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:52,765
playing

316
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,184
with you.

317
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,895
Thanks to you,

318
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:02,024
I got to remember

319
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:05,903
things from the past

320
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:09,031
I had long forgotten.

321
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:14,620
It'd been so long…

322
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:18,457
since

323
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:23,587
I had that much fun.

324
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,402
They're here.

325
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,780
People came to help.

326
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:34,825
You saw it, didn't you?

327
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:39,788
You lost.

328
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:17,368
You attend to the guests for me.

329
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:20,287
May I ask why?

330
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:28,671
Because there's no way watching it
can be more fun than playing it yourself.

331
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:52,194
INCREASE IN AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD DEBT
RANKING KOREA 2ND GLOBALLY

332
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:57,700
The country's household debt is rapidly
on the rise, topping the global average.

333
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:01,078
Last third quarter, the Bank of Korea
and the Bank for International Settlements

334
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:04,248
reported that the GDP to
household debt ratio was 96.9 percent…

335
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:06,125
Your hair grew out a lot.

336
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,294
How would you like it done?

337
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:10,087
Do you want to cut it short?

338
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:13,090
Or if you're growing it out,
do you want it permed?

339
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:17,428
…making it the biggest increase
among 43 countries, besides China.

340
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:21,473
The reason for the steep rise
in Korea's household debt

341
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:26,353
is due to the lift on government
restrictions on loans.

342
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:37,448

00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:57,843
You must be Cheol.

344
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:06,226
You look a lot like your sister.

345
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:12,358
Mister.

346
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:15,944
Do you know my sister?

347
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:20,699
I'm…

348
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:25,245
a friend of hers.

349
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:28,666
Then do you know where she is?

350
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:42,971
Is this the boy?

351
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:45,849
Yes.

352
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,062
What's your name?

353
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,439
Cheol.

354
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:54,817
I'm Kang Cheol.

355
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,485
Kang Cheol?

356
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:59,571
Goodness, you have a very manly name.

357
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:02,574
And you look like a tough boy too.

358
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:06,453
-Please look after him.
-All right.

359
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:11,834
I just have to get him a spoon
and have him join my meals.

360
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:14,211
Don't worry and have a good trip.

361
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:15,671
Okay.

362
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:30,185
Cheol, have you eaten?

363
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:33,147
Goodness, come and take a seat.

364
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,649
I'll give you a fish bun.

365
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:37,693
Eat up.

366
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:42,865
Goodness, you're dressed too lightly
in this cold weather.

367
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:45,117
Don't you have anything warmer?

368
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,849
IT'S THE MONEY I OWE SANG-WOO

369
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:16,607
Gi-hun.

370
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:22,696
Gi-hun!

371
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:30,078
This station is Incheon Airport
Terminal One.

372
00:46:47,804 --> 00:46:50,766
Hey, I'm almost at the airport now.

373
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:52,434
I'll board the plane soon.

374
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,648
Of course, I bought a present for you.

375
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:01,068
No. It's a secret.

376
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,862
I'll show it to you in person.

377
00:47:08,825 --> 00:47:10,077
Hold on, Ga-yeong.

378
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:14,331
Ga-yeong, I'll call you again
once I get there.

379
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:17,417
I love you too.

380
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:29,888
Let's play another round. Now!

381
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:21,064
What the hell are you doing?

382
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:23,066
Give that back!

383
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:25,527
No!

384
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:27,571
Never!

385
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:34,202
This is the final boarding call
for U-Way Airlines.

386
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:40,917
All boarding for U-Way flight 202
headed for Los Angeles will close shortly.

387
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:46,798
Passengers headed for Los Angeles,
please head to Gate 22 immediately.

388
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:34,638
Do you wish to participate in the game?

389
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:39,309
If you wish to play,
state your name and date of birth.

390
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:41,687
Seong Gi-hun.

391
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:45,857
October 31, 1974.

392
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:51,196
Listen carefully.

393
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:54,574
I'm not a horse.

394
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:57,411
I'm a person.

395
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:01,164
That's why I want to know

396
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:04,960
who you people are…

397
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:11,091
and how you can commit
such atrocities against people.

398
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:12,843
Player 456.

399
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,262
Don't get any absurd ideas.

400
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:17,139
That's why…

401
00:50:19,015 --> 00:50:20,392
I can't forgive you

402
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:23,812
for everything you're doing.

403
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:26,064
Just get on that plane.

404
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:27,816
It's for your own good.

405
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:04,407
