1
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,247
What about the intruder?

2
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,250
We didn't find him yet.

3
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,173
Make sure you catch him.

4
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:49,799
The VIPs will arrive soon.

5
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,195
EPISODE 7
VIPS

6
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:39,641
Deok-su, you're finally back.

7
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:42,602
You…

8
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,354
How…

9
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:45,855
What?

10
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,567
Does it feel like
your dead mother's come back to life?

11
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:57,575
Those masked guys
said I was the weakest link.

12
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:03,957
Just like how we called someone who was
left without a partner when we were kids.

13
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,292
Hey, you've all heard of it too, right?

14
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,544
The weakest link!

15
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:13,341
Then they nicely escorted me back here.

16
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,304
Well,

17
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,558
they said that it's a beautiful rule

18
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:23,977
kids used to keep,

19
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:27,814
so the weakest kid doesn't turn
into an outcast.

20
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,441
God, damn.

21
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:33,236
Isn't that freaking cool?

22
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,719
Are you in here right now?

23
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:42,639
You made one mistake.

24
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,517
I always put the receiver down
the opposite way.

25
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:01,366
The bullet you shot
was for the Smith and Wesson M60 revolver,

26
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,660
the model that Korean police carry.

27
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,872
What's a cop doing here

28
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:11,459
alone without a partner?

29
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,922
I'm sure you have lots of questions.

30
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,051
Come out and talk with me.

31
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:23,888
I don't know how you got in,

32
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:27,308
but you can't leave this place
without my permission.

33
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,824
We found a body.

34
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:25,992
Where?

35
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,703
The northern coast of the island.

36
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,053
Don't make a big deal out of it.

37
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,602
He was just an old man
you got to know here.

38
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:40,566
That man's partner

39
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:42,652
was his wife.

40
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,558
We found this police ID.

41
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,689
HWANG JUN-HO
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

42
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,527
The VIPS have arrived.

43
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,534
Incinerate the body.

44
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:43,754
Let's end this. I can't do this anymore.

45
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:50,428
We can stop if the majority of us agree.

46
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,972
If nine of us agree,
we can get out of here.

47
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,100
Don't any of you want to leave?

48
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,186
If you wish to leave with me,

49
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,729
please stand up.

50
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,363
How do you call yourselves human?

51
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:13,159
Are you really going to continue
with this insanity?

52
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:15,536
Because of that money!

53
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:21,542
You all killed the one
you were closest to in this place

54
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,419
because of that money.

55
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,880
If we get out…

56
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:31,552
Will your wife come back to life
if we get out of here?

57
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,681
Will you be forgiven
for killing your wife?

58
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,935
If you're that tormented,
why did you come back alive?

59
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,479
You should've died instead of her.

60
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:44,315
That…

61
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,401
isn't just your wife

62
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:50,154
but the cost of everyone who died here.

63
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,406
-No.
-You want us to leave that and go?

64
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,659
You want us to leave
and start a shitty life

65
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,537
all over again from rock bottom

66
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:00,289
with this shitty guilt in our hearts?

67
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,585
Are you all ready to live like that?

68
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,756
If you can,
then go ahead and get up right now.

69
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,676
Get up and leave here!

70
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,643
No…

71
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,675
The VIPs have arrived.

72
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:55,751
Your shift is over.

73
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,740
Player 69, eliminated.

74
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:28,928
The fifth game will begin momentarily.

75
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:33,682
All players, follow staff's instructions
and proceed to the game hall

76
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,705
Welcome to the fifth game.

77
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,541
Before we begin the game,

78
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,336
please choose a mannequin before you

79
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:12,132
numbered from 1 through 16.

80
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,136
Let me repeat.

81
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,971
Before we begin,

82
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:24,937
please choose a mannequin before you
numbered from 1 through 16.

83
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,531
There are 16 people left,

84
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,867
and there are 16 numbers.

85
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:38,510
God created man on the sixth day
in this world.

86
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:42,139
I'm going back to that day God created

87
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,558
the sinless and innocent man.

88
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,865
Okay. Lucky number, seven.

89
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,227
What should I do?

90
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,103
The middle numbers are all taken.

91
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,460
Attention, please.

92
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:55,420
The numbers before you

93
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:59,007
are the order in which you'll be playing.

94
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,510
Please choose carefully.

95
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:03,762
Order?

96
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:05,847
The order we play?

97
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:12,437
Okay. If this is the order we play,
the front numbers are advantageous.

98
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:17,859
There's a high chance there's a time limit
like Red Light, Green Light and Honeycomb.

99
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,028
It's better to get a head start.

100
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:22,823
No.

101
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:24,074
Wait.

102
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:28,036
It'd be too dangerous to go first
without knowing the game.

103
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:32,708
From the back, I can watch those who play
first and make a plan like Tug-of-war.

104
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:43,552
Number 16?

105
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,263
I can't go with 16.

106
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:47,889
I don't want to go last.

107
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:02,571
No. 1? That means
I'll be starting the game off.

108
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,115
Then should I go last?

109
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:07,993
No, that doesn't seem right either.

110
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:11,997
Come on, Gi-hun!

111
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:53,371
Excuse me.

112
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,587
May I take No. 1?

113
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:05,634
I lived my entire life
hiding behind others like a coward.

114
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:10,055
I've never lived
like I was in control of my own life.

115
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:14,351
I keep saying I shouldn't,
but I always get scared.

116
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:21,775
Even today, I chickened out
and ended up choosing last again.

117
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:26,238
I want at least one chance
to be the owner of my life,

118
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,949
confidently at the very front.

119
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,285
Please.

120
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:42,963
Thank you!

121
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:55,160
Players, welcome to the fifth game.

122
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:59,581
The fifth game is Glass Stepping Stones.

123
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:04,169
Each stepping stone is made with
either of two types of glass,

124
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:07,422
tempered glass and normal glass.

125
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:13,094
Tempered glass is strong enough
to hold even two players' weight.

126
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:17,057
However, normal glass will break
even if just one player steps on it.

127
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:21,102
Players, you will guess
which one of the two tiles

128
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:24,022
is made of tempered glass,

129
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:27,943
and step only on those
among 18 pairs of tiles

130
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:32,530
to cross to the other side safely
and pass this game.

131
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,088
That means these numbers are…

132
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,632
The order in which you cross the bridge.

133
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:17,033
How do I tell which one is tempered glass?

134
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:30,315
You have 16 minutes.

135
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:33,568
You have 16 minutes to cross the bridge.

136
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:36,863
Then let the game begin.

137
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:41,659
Take your shoes off,
then go up on the bridge in order.

138
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:08,728
-What are you doing?
-We're losing time!

139
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:09,813
-Hurry up and go!
-Just jump!

140
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:11,606
-Are you just going to stand there?
-Hey.

141
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:14,359
If you don't go, I'll push you.

142
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:17,821
I'll go. I'll go, okay?

143
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:20,407
Please choose wisely, okay?

144
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:26,496
Good job!

145
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:29,916
That's good!

146
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:34,421
Yes, that's it.
Keep doing that one after the other.

147
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:36,005
-Good job.
-You can do it!

148
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,173
That's it. Great job.

149
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:50,645
He's gone.

150
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:28,475
First, it was left.

151
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:31,436
The second, right.

152
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:57,670
You can do it.

153
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:58,755
You got this.

154
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:00,381
Hurry up and go!

155
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:03,760
-There are 15 more tiles ahead of me.
-Hurry up!

156
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:04,844
-Jump!
-Stop stalling!

157
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:07,764
-We don't have time!
-The probability that I'll get to the end…

158
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:10,433
-You got this!
-two to the power of fifteen.

159
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:21,945
That's a 1-in-32,768 chance.

160
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:30,453
Shit.

161
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:21,921
Ma'am.

162
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:23,506
By any chance,

163
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:27,927
do you remember which way he went next?

164
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:30,513
I can't seem to remember.

165
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:33,766
It all happened too quickly.

166
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,184
Try to remember.

167
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:38,563
I need to get this right for you to live.

168
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:40,273
Well…

169
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,361
I think it was left.

170
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:47,530
No! He went right, then left.

171
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,532
No, he went left straight away.

172
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:51,451
No, it was right from there.

173
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:01,836
Are you sure…

174
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:05,882
he went left?

175
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:08,092
Yes.

176
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:31,074
So he went right.

177
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:05,024
There are ten tiles left,

178
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:07,026
and 11 people standing.

179
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,904
If they manage to choose
one or two right tiles,

180
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:12,782
we'll all be able to cross safely.

181
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:14,617
That might not be the case.

182
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:18,162
If people at the front
get scared and waste time,

183
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:20,957
it'll put us at the back in danger.

184
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:53,072
Our Father who art in heaven

185
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:56,200
-What the hell are you doing?
-Hallowed be thy name…

186
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,619
-Are you seriously praying right now?
-…thy will be done on earth

187
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,580
-What's he doing up there?
-as it is in heaven.

188
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:01,789
-Just go!
-Forgive us our trespasses…

189
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:04,167
-Cut that nonsense and get up.
-as we forgive those

190
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,627
-who trespass against us.
-It's your turn, idiot!

191
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:09,630
-And lead us not into temptation.
-Just go! Or we'll all die!

192
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:17,138
There is no order in which God calls us.

193
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,643
The day of judgment is upon us.

194
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:25,897
All of us…

195
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,859
will end up in Hell, anyway.

196
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:31,944
Do something to make him go.

197
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:35,114
If you don't,
I might have to push you forward.

198
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:41,871
If you don't want to die first,
make that praying jerk go forward.

199
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,961
-Get up already, you idiot!
-Let go.

200
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:52,924
Step forward, you crazy jerk!

201
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:20,368
Thank you, Lord.

202
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,964
Don't push me.

203
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:34,298
I'll go.

204
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:37,218
Don't worry. Why would I kill you?

205
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,596
You have to cross for me to live, right?

206
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:26,934
The left.

207
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,103
It's the left one.

208
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:30,813
Pull yourself together.

209
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:34,692
Okay.

210
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:45,161
Thanks.

211
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:00,968
Great job. Keep it up.

212
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:10,186
I think I know
which one the tempered glass is.

213
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:11,354
Really?

214
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:13,981
Can you really tell?

215
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,233
I got the hang of it.

216
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,902
The colors are different.

217
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:33,125
Dimwit. You don't know anything.

218
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:01,320
Hey, you assholes!

219
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,323
I'm not taking another step!

220
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,951
If you want to go, you can go first!

221
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:09,870
Damn it.

222
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:11,098
Bon appétit!

223
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:23,319
-What are you doing?
-Don't you understand Korean?

224
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,571
I'm not moving forward.

225
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:26,947
Quit your dirty tricks!

226
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:29,950
The rule is that we go in order.

227
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,456
Piss off, fucker.

228
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:39,001
This is hell. There are no rules in hell.

229
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:41,087
If you're dying to go, go first.

230
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,089
You fucker!

231
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,093
If you don't go, I'll push you.

232
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:48,511
Sure.

233
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:50,763
Sounds great, damn it.

234
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:53,432
Come at me! We'll all die here together!

235
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:55,267
Hey, assholes!

236
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:58,521
I'm not going to die for you to live.
So come at me!

237
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:01,899
Either you go first,

238
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,902
or we die here together.

239
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,738
It's one or the other.

240
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:10,074
Stop bluffing, bastard.

241
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:13,786
The time is ticking. You'll have to go.

242
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:15,830
Then wait around until we all die.

243
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:23,629
Damn it.

244
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:06,732
Damn it, you better go!

245
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:08,275
Hurry up and go!

246
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,235
Go yourself.

247
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:35,511
What freaking morons.

248
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:43,561
You acted like such a tough guy.

249
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:45,521
But you can't go?

250
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:48,899
Shit, how embarrassing.

251
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,818
Piss off, bitch.

252
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:54,238
I'm not going no matter what you say.

253
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:55,281
Deok-su.

254
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:59,034
I feel ashamed that I ever got it on

255
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:02,830
with a coward like you.

256
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,124
Then you can go first and die.

257
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:08,961
Move aside.

258
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:11,714
Really?

259
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:14,592
-You're going to go first?
-Yes.

260
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:16,969
It's me, Han Mi-nyeo.

261
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:22,141
I'm not going to stand around
with a coward like you

262
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:23,183
until I die.

263
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:30,524
You're welcome to do that.

264
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:42,286
Choose carefully.

265
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:50,836
What are you doing?

266
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:52,713
You naive idiot.

267
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:55,674
Did you really think
I'd die for you to live?

268
00:43:58,093 --> 00:43:59,094
Let me go.

269
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:00,220
Remember?

270
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,681
We promised to stick together
to the very end.

271
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:05,309
You lunatic! Damn it!

272
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:07,394
Let go of me, bitch!

273
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:11,690
Damn it.

274
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:17,696
I told you I'd kill you
if you betrayed me.

275
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:22,618
Don't do this.

276
00:44:23,118 --> 00:44:24,662
I'll go first, okay?

277
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:28,457
Please let go of me. Let go!

278
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:29,833
You coward.

279
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:32,586
Deok-su.

280
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:34,588
You know what?

281
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:37,675
Your dick is freaking small too.

282
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:41,011
Fuck.

283
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:29,184
Go check the VIP room.

284
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:48,620
What are you doing?

285
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:49,788
Stop stalling.

286
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:50,956
Wait, one second.

287
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:53,208
I know a way to tell these apart.

288
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:56,545
-How?
-I worked at a glass factory for 30 years.

289
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:58,964
Others can't see it,

290
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:03,552
but when you look at tempered glass
under light from an angle,

291
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:07,514
you'll be able to see faint stain marks.

292
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:25,741
Another hint is the sound.

293
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:30,287
Tempered glass is made
at high temperatures, above 700 degrees.

294
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:33,999
If you tap it with a hammer,
it rings clearer than normal glass.

295
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:36,210
Why are you telling us now?

296
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:37,503
If you had taken the lead--

297
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:38,670
Why should I?

298
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:41,924
Those people tried to kill me
every chance they had.

299
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:04,446
LONG-TERM WORK EXPERIENCE
IN GLASS MANUFACTURING

300
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:14,266
What's wrong?

301
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:16,268
What's the problem?

302
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:20,272
It's too dark to see.

303
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:38,915
The VIP has collapsed.

304
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:40,792
Is he alive?

305
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:42,294
He's fine.

306
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:43,545
What about the intruder?

307
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:45,422
We're searching for him.

308
00:48:56,516 --> 00:48:58,727
Which one will it be? Make your decision!

309
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:00,771
I need to listen to the sound.

310
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:04,650
Do you have anything to throw?

311
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:09,112
Got anything?

312
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:37,391
Give me one more.

313
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:40,185
I need to hear the right one too.

314
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:19,683
I can't tell.

315
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:21,685
Then just go.

316
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:26,142
One of the diving equipment is gone.

317
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:28,436
He must have left
through the underwater cave.

318
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:31,189
Track it and get the boat ready.

319
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:33,723
