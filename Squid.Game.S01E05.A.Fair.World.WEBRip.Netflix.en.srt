1
00:00:11,928 --> 00:00:15,932
Do something! God damn it!

2
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,643
Pull yourselves together and listen up!

3
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:22,063
When I give the sign,
just take three steps forward!

4
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:24,899
Go forward? Are you crazy?

5
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,026
We have to make them trip!

6
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,570
That's bullshit!

7
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:29,946
Let's give it a shot!

8
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:31,823
No, I can't do it!

9
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:33,575
If you can't, you'll die!

10
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:35,618
On the count of three! One!

11
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,120
Two!

12
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:38,496
Three!

13
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:47,797
Pull!

14
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,260
Pull…

15
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,077
Pull!

16
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:21,164
No!

17
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:23,875
No!

18
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:30,692
EPISODE 5
A FAIR WORLD

19
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,256
Hey.

20
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,259
Who are you praying to right now?

21
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,095
To God?

22
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:03,308
Do you think you're alive thanks to God?

23
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,984
You're still breathing
and moving that tongue of yours

24
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,361
thanks to that old man

25
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:20,783
and that guy over there who came up
with an awesome last-minute trick.

26
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:24,579
So if you're going to thank anyone,

27
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:27,040
thank them.

28
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:31,878
You poor lost sheep.

29
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:35,089
Can't you hear the cries of those
who were nailed to the cross today?

30
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,427
We lived to see another day
thanks to their blood and sacrifice.

31
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,931
On behalf of all us sinners,

32
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:46,517
I gave thanks to the Lord's decision
of their sacrifice

33
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:48,478
and said a prayer.

34
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,729
Bullshit.

35
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:52,649
You killed them yourself.

36
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:59,489
Do we all go to heaven
if we say a few prayers?

37
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:02,158
Shit, then I have to pray too.

38
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,619
Heavenly Father,

39
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:08,915
we worked together as a team today
to send many people to your side.

40
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:12,293
Please help us send
more people to your side from now on--

41
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,753
Be quiet.

42
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:19,968
Me?

43
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,761
Or that guy?

44
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,263
Both of you.

45
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:45,660
What's your name?

46
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:48,496
Why do you want to know?

47
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,540
To call you by your name, obviously.

48
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:51,708
Don't call me then.

49
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:53,835
You're so secretive.

50
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,754
Do me a favor.

51
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,715
Just leave me alone.

52
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,385
You're the one who talked to me first.

53
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:11,102
Did you see that bald guy wet his pants?

54
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:14,689
After that, all the kids behind him kept…

55
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:56,541
He's not breathing.

56
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,000
Go get the doctor.

57
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:06,425
I seriously thought
we were all going to die.

58
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:09,804
But once I laid back,
I really felt much more powerful.

59
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:11,389
"What is this? This works?"

60
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:13,349
Sir, how did you come up with that?

61
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,436
When I was young, I just--

62
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,772
You copied that from a movie, right?
What's that movie?

63
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,524
You know, the one that goes like this.

64
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,109
The Matrix.

65
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:29,907
Hey, did you only watch movies in Korea
instead of work?

66
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:33,703
And you, babe.

67
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,998
"Just take three steps forward!"

68
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,293
I mean, that was way too cool.

69
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:42,628
How did you come up with that
in that situation?

70
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,255
You said that was bullshit.

71
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:46,757
I did?

72
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:49,260
What bullshit are you saying?

73
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:50,553
You were crying,

74
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:53,931
"Are you crazy? That's bullshit!"

75
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,391
That's what you said.

76
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,727
Hey! Which country are you from?

77
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,605
Do you even have a visa?
You're an illegal alien, right?

78
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,648
Gosh. Look, boys.

79
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,109
Should we really
let this strange foreign guy

80
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,570
stay on our team? Should we?

81
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:10,740
I need to restructure this team
while I have the chance.

82
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,617
Who's the leader here?

83
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:17,079
Cool guy, are you the leader?

84
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:20,708
We don't have a leader.
We're all equal on this team.

85
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:22,835
Even better.

86
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,296
An egalitarian society!

87
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:29,175
Shit, it's totally different
from some damn thug

88
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:32,595
who runs everything as he wants
like he's the king.

89
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,389
But, why did you get kicked out, ma'am?

90
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:38,935
Babe.

91
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,479
Don't call me ma'am.

92
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,024
My name is Han Mi-nyeo.

93
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:47,318
Just call me Mi-nyeo.

94
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,863
And I wasn't kicked out.

95
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,740
I chose to leave the team.

96
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:56,536
Those thugs and I were
on completely different levels.

97
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:57,828
They only abandoned you,

98
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,997
then picked out able-bodied men.

99
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:02,291
Right before the game at that.

100
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,794
It's as if they knew what game
we were playing next.

101
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:14,345
Lights-out will be in 30 minutes.

102
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:17,139
Please get ready to sleep.

103
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,892
Another fight might break out tonight.

104
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,102
We should be prepared.

105
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:22,979
How so?

106
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,897
We have these women and an old man.

107
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,524
We're the weakest team here.

108
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,443
Let's pick a weak team
and attack them first.

109
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:34,240
The Lord's servant is more brutal than us.

110
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:35,908
We're all sinners already.

111
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,829
Our hands are drenched in blood.

112
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,834
Offense is the best form of defense.
Let's attack first.

113
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,627
During the fight last night,

114
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,256
do you know
how the man in front of me died?

115
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,760
Someone who he thought
was on his side broke his neck.

116
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,263
Do you all trust me?

117
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,183
I don't trust any of you.

118
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,522
All right.

119
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,941
We should focus on
protecting ourselves first.

120
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,612
Let's set up a barricade
before the lights go out.

121
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,406
It'll help to have some form of cover.

122
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,062
Hey, Mr. Ssangmun-dong.

123
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,567
You're trying so hard to stay alive.

124
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,070
But

125
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,238
do you think these will help?

126
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,700
It looks mighty drafty.

127
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,370
What about you?

128
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,248
Those scumbags on your so-called team.

129
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:08,709
Do you really trust them?

130
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,255
Try me.

131
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:15,925
Try it, bitch.

132
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,468
Go ahead. Bring it on.

133
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,345
If I were one of them,

134
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:24,100
once the fighting starts at night,

135
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:27,311
I'd wait for a chance to kill you first.

136
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,525
You're the strongest one after all.

137
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,161
How's that?

138
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,252
Boss.

139
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,796
Which team should we crush first?

140
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,256
Let's take the night off.

141
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,049
Why?

142
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,176
Let's cut down the numbers--

143
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,594
Let's just rest.

144
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:03,681
Okay.

145
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:06,350
Hey.

146
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:09,687
All of you, put those down
and get some rest.

147
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,111
Where's the doc?

148
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:21,532
He went out a moment ago
to use the restroom.

149
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,741
The lights will go out soon.

150
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,618
They won't attack us so easily,

151
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:08,787
but let's take turns
keeping watch just in case.

152
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:09,955
Let's do it in pairs.

153
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,958
There's a chance one may fall asleep

154
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:16,337
or side with another team to betray us.

155
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,216
I'll

156
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,426
go first.

157
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,596
Old people don't get very sleepy.

158
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:26,680
Sir,

159
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:30,643
how are we going to trust an old man
like you and sleep in peace?

160
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,356
I'll go first.

161
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:40,528
I'll join you.

162
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,279
I'm not sleepy right now.

163
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,990
Then I'll go next.

164
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,326
Wake me up when you get tired.

165
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,746
Then I'll join you,

166
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,332
if you're okay with it.

167
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,626
Let's do that.

168
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:13,310
The work schedule is done for today.

169
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,730
All workers, please return to your rooms.

170
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,987
All workers,
please return to your rooms immediately.

171
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:44,633
Have this.

172
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:48,345
I saved it from dinner earlier.

173
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,347
To give it to you, sir.

174
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,308
Why would you do that?

175
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,644
You saved my life today, sir.

176
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,397
I wanted to thank you.

177
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,940
There's no need to thank me.

178
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,817
I did it to save myself.

179
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,777
You gave me the bus fare too.

180
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,698
I should return the favor.

181
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:16,916
Happy?

182
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,507
Your name is Ali, right?

183
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,468
How old are you?

184
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,888
I'm 33 years old.

185
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,891
Then just call me Sang-woo.

186
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:36,560
May I do that,

187
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:38,896
Sang-woo?

188
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:47,196
How did you end up here?

189
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,949
I came to Korea to make money,

190
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:51,992
Sang-woo.

191
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,370
No, I don't mean Korea. Here.

192
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,330
This game.

193
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:58,707
I came because

194
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:00,918
I had no money.

195
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,007
Any family?

196
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:14,807
My mom, dad, and younger siblings
are back in Pakistan.

197
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:19,603
And my wife and baby are in Korea with me.

198
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,271
You have a kid?

199
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,608
How old?

200
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:25,901
A one-year-old son.

201
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,698
You must miss them.

202
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:33,867
I do.

203
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,499
How did you end up

204
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:42,793
here?

205
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:48,632
Because I had no money.

206
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,801
To make money.

207
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,590
Number 29,

208
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:32,426
what happened yesterday?
Why didn't you show up?

209
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:34,970
Sorry.

210
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,306
"Sorry"?

211
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:42,436
I stopped the others from killing you
because they can't trust you.

212
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:47,900
I owed it to you for saving my life
on our dive last time.

213
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,279
If you do that again, you're out.

214
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:26,605
Number 29. You're finally here.

215
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:28,649
I gave him a warning.

216
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,609
We couldn't make the delivery last night.

217
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,611
We can't let it slide with a warning!

218
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,905
Then you can deliver it yourself.

219
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:39,284
Do you think it's easy to find
divers like us in this place?

220
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:42,121
Make sure today's delivery
goes without a hitch.

221
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,965
What? You're not even done with one?

222
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:56,093
The doctor is
much slower than usual today.

223
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:58,095
Hey, quack. Hurry it up.

224
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:01,306
It's all in vain if the ship
leaves before we deliver.

225
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,852
Try doing this without getting
much sleep or decent food

226
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,689
while barely escaping death every day.

227
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:24,621
And so we tell you what the game is
and give you extra food

228
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,748
to make sure you don't die.

229
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:47,978
Gi-hun.

230
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,146
Sang-woo.

231
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:50,814
Let's switch.

232
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,109
Okay, sure.

233
00:19:58,739 --> 00:19:59,615
Will you be okay?

234
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:00,532
What?

235
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,285
It looks like you had a nightmare.

236
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,661
No.

237
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,205
I'm fine.

238
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:09,333
Hey.

239
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,127
Why aren't you sleeping, Boss?

240
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,673
I can't seem to fall asleep.

241
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,801
I'm keeping everyone safe.

242
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,429
Don't worry and go to sleep.

243
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,474
I trust you, punk.

244
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,021
The doc still isn't back?

245
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:31,939
No.

246
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:34,441
It's weird. He's been gone far too long.

247
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,822
Hold it.

248
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,619
We're in a hurry.

249
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,621
Should I try working on those?

250
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:51,083
I think I can do it
if you teach me a few tricks.

251
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,627
Does it look easy
because I'm here like this?

252
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:58,840
I saw on the news that nurse aides
or office managers often perform surgery.

253
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,678
And some of them are better than doctors.

254
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,805
If you're that confident, do it yourself.

255
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:11,186
The quack who killed a man
by malpractice is still so proud.

256
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,690
If you're so good,
how'd you ruin the eyeballs last time?

257
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,775
Our buyers bashed me for it!

258
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:19,945
It was because that guy was still alive!

259
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:22,698
Everything was ruined
because he woke up and struggled!

260
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,574
We have no time for this.

261
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,034
The ship will arrive soon.

262
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,752
Gi-hun.

263
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:29,973
Hey.

264
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:37,272
What are you thinking about so deeply?

265
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:41,234
I thought you were sleeping
with your eyes open.

266
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,740
I was thinking about the past.

267
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:48,075
The past?

268
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:53,121
We once went on strike at my old company.

269
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,834
We set up a barricade like this.

270
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,504
What kind of company did you work for?

271
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:02,089
A car company.

272
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,219
What was the strike for?

273
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,180
They fired us because
they were financially troubled.

274
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:14,726
I'd worked there for over a decade.

275
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,147
It must've been tough.

276
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,488
My kid was about to be born,

277
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:29,908
and I had a million things to pay for.

278
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:34,830
They suddenly told us to leave,
so I had no alternative.

279
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:39,626
They ruined the company
and held us responsible.

280
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:42,337
It made me furious.

281
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,091
Just like now, my colleagues and I

282
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:52,180
took turns keeping watch at night
to occupy the factory.

283
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:56,643
Scared the police might
barge in any minute,

284
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:00,021
we trembled every night.

285
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,899
I remember. About ten years ago or so,

286
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:07,946
there was a big strike at a car company.

287
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:13,577
I think the news turned it
into a big story too.

288
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:17,956
Someone died there, right?

289
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:19,749
Yes.

290
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:22,586
Goodness.

291
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:24,629
I'm sorry.

292
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,381
I shouldn't

293
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:28,967
have mentioned it.

294
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:44,024
Sir.

295
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:46,943
Are you okay?

296
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:53,116
-You're burning up.
-It's okay.

297
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,619
I nearly wet my pants that night.

298
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:58,997
I thought that thing was dead,
but it suddenly got up like a zombie,

299
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,708
and glared at me with one eye popping out.

300
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,711
I saw it in my dreams last night.

301
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:06,713
Everyone who failed Red Light, Green Light

302
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:08,673
was shot by a sniper rifle,

303
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,176
so we could hardly salvage anything.

304
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:15,180
I thought that zombie was decent
just by its looks.

305
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:19,893
I almost died delivering on that day,
but we didn't even get full price

306
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:21,645
because it only had one kidney.

307
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:24,064
Is it my fault
that the zombie had only one kidney?

308
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,483
Hopefully, this guy is all right.

309
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:31,279
Most of the people here either signed
away their bodies or are terminally ill.

310
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,864
I don't feel great about this.

311
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:38,411
Lie down.

312
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:41,414
Wait here.

313
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:43,708
We need to lower your fever.

314
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:50,340
Darn it.

315
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:51,508
Use this.

316
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,435
What happened…

317
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:05,647
to that zombie?

318
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,733
What do you think?

319
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:12,237
I hurriedly beat it to death
with that over there.

320
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:18,827
Why do you ask, though?

321
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,161
You saw it all.

322
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,413
What's wrong with you?

323
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:23,707
Don't you remember?

324
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:28,295
Back then,

325
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,423
I was a bit out of it.

326
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:32,757
You were out of it?

327
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:36,928
You even got rid of the body
with your own hands.

328
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,223
Number 29.

329
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:44,060
-You--
-This is my operating room!

330
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:48,606
Stop chitchatting and hold this properly!

331
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,652
Let me focus on my work!

332
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:56,239
If you don't, I'll cut through
his liver and kidneys with this!

333
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,254
Thank you.

334
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:17,594
Get some rest.

335
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:23,641
You need to get better
and play another game with us tomorrow.

336
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:34,986
You should go back to sleep.

337
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:37,697
I can do this alone.

338
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,158
We agreed to do it in pairs.

339
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:43,453
I'm already awake anyway.

340
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,208
Thanks

341
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:54,589
for the water.

342
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:57,550
It wasn't for free.

343
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:00,762
Pay me back tomorrow.

344
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:20,990
-Hurry.
-They're all in great condition this time.

345
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:23,076
Make sure you get full price.

346
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:35,004
Hurry. The ship is already here.

347
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:52,981
Tell me now.

348
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:54,733
What's the next game?

349
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,109
We don't know yet.

350
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,278
What do you mean?

351
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,155
You don't know?

352
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,990
We haven't been told yet.

353
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,867
Then go ask your boss.

354
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,619
I'm sure there's someone behind you!

355
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:08,580
If he knew, he would've told us already.

356
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:11,583
-I'm sure there's a reason.
-That's your problem.

357
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,502
I did everything you told me to.

358
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:16,796
Go tell him to find out now!

359
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,381
Go back and wait!

360
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:20,258
I'll tell you before the game begins.

361
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:22,886
That's bullshit!

362
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:43,656
What is it?

363
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,158
Pull.

364
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:30,495
-Calm down.
-If I don't find out what the game is,

365
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:32,539
they'll kill me in there tonight.

366
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:35,750
You won't find out anything like this.
Give us some time.

367
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,127
Do you think I'll trust scumbags like you?

368
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:39,254
What else can we do?

369
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,922
You go and find out.

370
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,675
And you.

371
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:45,927
You're staying here with me
until he gets back.

372
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,513
It'll be more dangerous
if we stay here like this.

373
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:50,431
We must return before morning roll call.

374
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,767
That's none of my fucking business!

375
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:57,188
I'm not going back
until I find out what the game is.

376
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,482
Fine, okay. Calm down.

377
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:02,902
Go up there and find out what the game is.

378
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,321
Okay.

379
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:11,995
Wait!

380
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,038
You have to take the key.

381
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:17,333
The key to go upstairs
is in my right pocket.

382
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:20,336
Don't try anything funny.

383
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,546
I'm not.

384
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:24,090
He needs it to enter the control room.

385
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:26,926
If you don't trust me,
you can throw it to him yourself.

386
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,134
Don't touch it.

387
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:10,303
-It's a bomb.
-A bomb?

388
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:13,973
This passage was made
for the VIPs to escape in an emergency.

389
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,516
Once they're out,

390
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,436
they set it off and bury the entire place.

391
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:21,230
What kind of people are the VIPs?

392
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,608
Not our business.

393
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,297
Number 29.

394
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:59,394
Emergency. The doc is escaping.

395
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:06,859
Shit.

396
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:22,333
Damn it.

397
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,689
Why do you want to know who the VIPs are?

398
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:48,192
I was just grateful

399
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:51,738
for our diving equipment and this passage.

400
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:54,449
They prepared it all for us.

401
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:56,159
Not only did you get more curious,

402
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,078
your voice seems to have changed.

403
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,621
Let me see your face.

404
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:04,042
Do you have to do this?

405
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:09,255
Should I kill you to find out?

406
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,852
Who are you?

407
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,489
Let me see your face.

408
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:38,076
Should I kill you to find out?

409
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,388
Don't come closer!

410
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:03,309
Calm down. We can still fix this.

411
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:04,811
How will you fix this?

412
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,188
By killing me?

413
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,606
Think about it.

414
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:10,358
Why would I kill you?

415
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:12,276
That'll only complicate things.

416
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,112
Things are already complicated.

417
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:16,239
Your friend is dead.

418
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:17,782
He wasn't a friend.

419
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:21,994
I'll throw those bodies
into the incinerator and burn them.

420
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:24,413
It won't leave a trace.

421
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:27,708
It's a huge problem
if a player goes missing,

422
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,586
but a missing soldier is
no problem at all.

423
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:34,257
Who am I?

424
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:37,468
What's important isn't who I am.

425
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:46,477
What's important is
the identity of the man you did this to.

426
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,647
The man you called a zombie.

427
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,526
The man with one kidney
who woke up on the table.

428
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,696
Do you know where his other kidney is?

429
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:58,739
In here.

430
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:00,867
It's in here.

431
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,078
He gave it to me.

432
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,999
-That man is my brother!
-No!

433
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:11,961
It was a woman.

434
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:13,254
A woman.

435
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,630
It wasn't a man.

436
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:17,300
I'll make sure
to find out what the next game is.

437
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:19,594
If you make a bigger scene and get caught,

438
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,138
both you and I will die in vain.

439
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:23,764
Trust me.

440
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:28,186
-We still have another chance.
-How can I trust a scumbag like you?

441
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:46,537
See?

442
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:49,540
I'm just another human like you.

443
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:04,472
Yes.

444
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:07,183
You just need to go back quietly.

445
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:09,685
If you return before bedtime is over,

446
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,730
you and I can both live.

447
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:21,572
Then what do I have to do?

448
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:26,827
Doctor.

449
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,002
Let's get you washed up first.

450
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,260
I'm telling the truth.

451
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:44,762
It was a woman.

452
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:46,264
How can I believe that?

453
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:48,933
Before we opened her up,

454
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:52,436
we took turns doing her.

455
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,064
Would we have done that to a guy?

456
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,359
If you still don't trust me,
go check the list.

457
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:00,987
-The list?
-There's a list of all the players

458
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,697
and their personal information.

459
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,283
-It even includes their medical records.
-Where?

460
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,371
Above the ladderway,

461
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,707
in the leader's room.

462
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:13,791
The leader?

463
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:15,668
You've seen him.

464
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:17,628
The one with a different mask.

465
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:30,224
I'll help you find your brother.

466
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:34,353
And you can have all the money I made
by selling the organs. I mean it!

467
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,024
Once we become a team…

468
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:58,878
Whether you sell
the dead bodies' organs or devour them,

469
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:00,796
I don't give a damn.

470
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,089
However,

471
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,884
you ruined the most important aspect
of this place.

472
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:10,806
Equality.

473
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:14,226
Everyone is equal
while they play this game.

474
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:18,773
Here, the players get to play a fair game
under the same conditions.

475
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:22,693
Those people suffered from inequality
and discrimination out in the world,

476
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:26,906
and we're giving them the last chance
to fight fair and win.

477
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:29,116
And you

478
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,868
broke that principle.

479
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:35,289
I'm sorry.

480
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:26,924
Sir,

481
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:28,843
we found another one.

482
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,035
It's Number 28.

483
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:37,411
There's one more,

484
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:39,455
the one who killed this one.

485
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:42,541
He could've escaped to the sea already.

486
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:47,421
The oxygen tanks are all here.

487
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:48,714
He's still here.

488
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:50,758
Find him.

489
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,826
LIST OF PLAYERS, 1999

490
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:16,779
LIST OF PLAYERS 1

491
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:43,806
Number 29 is gone too.

492
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:45,474
Find him.

493
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:48,811
He's not on the security cameras either.

494
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:54,858
He has to be in here.

495
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:05,244
All players, please line up in the middle.

496
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:07,204
Let me repeat.

497
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:09,456
-All players,
-Everyone, come out to the middle.

498
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,875
please line up in the middle.

499
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:15,212
Move it.

500
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:18,924
Damn it. What the hell
