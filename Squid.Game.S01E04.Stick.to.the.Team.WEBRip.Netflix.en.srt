1
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,035
Thanks.

2
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,130
-Gi-hun.
-Yes?

3
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,051
Never mind.

4
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,387
Thank you.

5
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:56,306
Sorry?

6
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,726
I lived because I copied your method.

7
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,578
Sirs!

8
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:27,087
You're alive.

9
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:28,797
I was worried.

10
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,382
Did you think I would die that easily?

11
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,594
I'm Seong Gi-hun of Ssangmun-dong.

12
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:37,972
Old sir, are you all right?

13
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,599
Yes, I'm fine.

14
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,435
It's all thanks to him.

15
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:44,813
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,856
I shouldn't have said we should split up.

17
00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:50,610
Don't say that.

18
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,363
It's not like you knew.

19
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,073
Besides, I chose the umbrella.

20
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:57,367
It's okay.

21
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,203
I'm glad everyone is fine.

22
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:06,251
We will now announce
the results of the second game.

23
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:17,053
Out of 187 players, 79 were eliminated.

24
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:40,118
The prize money accumulated this round
is 7.9 billion won.

25
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:46,499
The prize money accumulated so far
is 34.8 billion won.

26
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:56,634
EPISODE 4
STICK TO THE TEAM

27
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:59,012
Your mealtime begins now.

28
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:03,683
All players,
please form a line in the center.

29
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,491
This is all?

30
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,042
Those jerks.

31
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,795
Just a piece of bread before the game.

32
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,132
And this is all they give us
after our near-death experience?

33
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,646
Are they kidding me?

34
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:55,485
All right. Excuse me.

35
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,111
Excuse me.

36
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,404
Thank you.

37
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:04,160
Hey, what are you doing?

38
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,583
Let's enjoy the food together.

39
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:35,525
Give me an egg and a soda.

40
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,403
We didn't get anything either.

41
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:40,613
One, two, three, four, five.

42
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,573
You're missing food for five people!

43
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,534
We prepared food
for the exact number of players.

44
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,245
Then why don't you have any left?
Give me my food!

45
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,664
We prepared food
for the exact number of players.

46
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:50,790
Excuse me.

47
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:55,253
Those people…

48
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:59,090
They took the food twice. I saw them.

49
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,179
Damn it, this is freaking annoying.

50
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:08,349
Have you never seen a person eat before?

51
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:13,855
Who do you think you are?

52
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,565
Why did you steal others' food?

53
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,776
Right, is this yours?

54
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:20,945
What's your name?

55
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,656
Is your name written on this?

56
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,036
I don't see it.

57
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:32,915
Give it back. It's mine.
Give it back to me!

58
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:40,048
You asshole.

59
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:42,717
It broke because of you, asshole!

60
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:49,223
How come a scrawny guy like you
is so greedy for food? You bastard!

61
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:53,978
Hey, I'm trying to say
that we need to share.

62
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,731
Is that so hard, you jerk?

63
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:58,983
You bastard!

64
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,380
Excuse me. Hey, wake…

65
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,476
He's dead.

66
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:43,361
Excuse me!

67
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:46,781
He's dead.

68
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,245
Do you hear me?

69
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,165
A person has died.

70
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,959
He just died.

71
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,047
A person has died.

72
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,800
That bastard just killed him.

73
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,097
He just killed a person!

74
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:14,684
Can't you hear me?

75
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,395
A man just died!

76
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,148
Can't you hear me?

77
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,941
This isn't right!

78
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:24,569
We shouldn't be
killing each other like this!

79
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,575
Player 271, eliminated.

80
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:43,773
You there.

81
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,275
Why aren't you doing your job?

82
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,198
I'm sorry.

83
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,076
How may I help you?

84
00:08:58,746 --> 00:08:59,914
Did you forget the rules?

85
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:03,417
You do not speak
before your superior allows you.

86
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,071
Lights-out in 30 minutes.

87
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:35,241
-Hurry. It'll be bedtime soon.
-Please return to the quarters now.

88
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,747
We can't fall asleep tonight.

89
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:44,292
Anything can happen after lights-out.

90
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:49,297
Those guys are definitely up to no good.

91
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,049
If anyone gets attacked,

92
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,094
we have to stick together and fight.

93
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,306
Come over to our side if anything happens.

94
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:00,558
All right.

95
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:03,978
Sir.

96
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:07,690
Sir?

97
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:14,113
You can't go to sleep
even after the lights go out, okay?

98
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:15,740
Why not?

99
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:18,868
Things will be a little dangerous tonight.
Keep your eyes open.

100
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,120
We'll come here if anything happens.

101
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,331
Okay. All right.

102
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,592
Hey, pickpocket.

103
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:38,596
Will you be all right?

104
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:42,516
It looked like you and that thug
weren't on good terms.

105
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,019
So what?

106
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:49,023
If anything happens after lights-out,
we're all meeting by my bed.

107
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,610
You should join us.

108
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,449
I don't trust people.

109
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,203
Especially people
who ended up in a place like this.

110
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:04,038
Are you seriously saying that to me?

111
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,210
You don't trust people
because they're trustworthy.

112
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:12,630
It's because
you have nothing else to lean on.

113
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:22,598
Where's the delivery team?

114
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,656
Number 28, why are you here alone?

115
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:40,825
Number 29 didn't show up.

116
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,827
-Was there an accident?
-I don't know.

117
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,995
Then you'll need to deliver this alone.

118
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,374
I can't go underwater by myself.
It's too dangerous.

119
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:50,251
Stop chatting and tell me now.

120
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:51,961
What's tomorrow's game?

121
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:03,514
Are you sure?

122
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,852
If I get eliminated,
you can't do this anymore.

123
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,354
Worry about that
after you survive the night.

124
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,523
What do you mean?

125
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:14,024
A fight will break out.

126
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:18,195
They gave them less food on purpose
to provoke a fight.

127
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:21,449
They're weeding out the weaklings
before the next game begins.

128
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:22,783
It's all part of the game.

129
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,161
We can't protect you when you're in there.

130
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:28,622
Go back and find a way to live.

131
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:30,416
A way to live?

132
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:31,876
Stick with the strongest team.

133
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,086
That's the only way.

134
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,175
Let me join…

135
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:24,553
your side.

136
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,389
Why should we?

137
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,310
What are you good at?

138
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:32,686
I'm a doctor outside.

139
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,563
I'll be of use.

140
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,606
So what?

141
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:39,193
Will you give us shots
if we catch a cold in here?

142
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,825
Once the lights are out,
sit quietly in a corner.

143
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,202
Don't even breathe.

144
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:50,955
If I hear you breathe,

145
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,417
I'll come for you.

146
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,382
I know

147
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:03,300
what the next game is.

148
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,265
Two minutes until lights-out.

149
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:14,228
The special game will begin momentarily.

150
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:20,693
Management, soldiers, and workers,
please move to your designated locations.

151
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,571
Let me repeat.

152
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:30,619
Management, soldiers, and workers,
please move to your designated locations.

153
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:41,630
Thirty seconds until lights-out.

154
00:14:55,853 --> 00:15:00,566
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

155
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:05,571
five, four, three, two, one.

156
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:43,776
So you saw me?

157
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:49,323
Bitch.

158
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:02,544
Begin.

159
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,043
You asshole!

160
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:02,289
Gi-hun. Are you okay?

161
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,249
-Sir.
-Yes. Thanks.

162
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,584
Where's the old man?

163
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,961
Where is he? Where's the old man?

164
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,438
-He's not here.
-Sir…

165
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:30,359
Sir? Sir!

166
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:31,860
Sir!

167
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:35,489
Die!

168
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:53,632
Help!

169
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,575
You're here.

170
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:20,784
You told me to.

171
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,724
Hey, Ssangmun-dong.
Why are you butting in?

172
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:46,810
It's good for you too with fewer people.

173
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,813
She's on our side too.

174
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,108
Damn it.

175
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:55,819
Please,

176
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,196
stop!

177
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,948
I'm…

178
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,283
scared.

179
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:05,871
At this rate, we'll all die!

180
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:11,335
Everyone is going to die!

181
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:16,757
I'm so scared.

182
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,009
Stop it!

183
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:21,178
-End the game.
-If you keep going like this,

184
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:24,389
everyone will die!

185
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,049
Drop your weapon.

186
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:01,927
Turn around.

187
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:28,996
Player 277, eliminated.
Player 74, eliminated.

188
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:31,248
Player 198, eliminated.

189
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:32,374
Player 87, eliminated.

190
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:35,460
-Player 456.
-Player 222, eliminated.

191
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,504
-Is there a man named Hwang In-ho here?
-Player 301, eliminated.

192
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:41,550
-Player 416, eliminated.
-We do not know each other's names.

193
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,969
Player 361, eliminated.

194
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:47,264
Player 328, eliminated.

195
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,142
Player 103, eliminated.

196
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:52,644
Player 198, eliminated.

197
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,438
Player 6, eliminated.

198
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,189
Player 206, eliminated.

199
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,400
Player 233, eliminated.

200
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,819
Player 239, eliminated.

201
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:26,928
Are you all right?

202
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,264
What?

203
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:32,642
When did you climb all the way up there?
It was dangerous.

204
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:35,645
We were worried
because we couldn't find you.

205
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:37,856
It's a relief none of us were badly hurt.

206
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:45,572
Why don't we take this opportunity
to exchange names?

207
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:49,034
Come to think of it,
we don't even know each other's names.

208
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,494
I know your name.

209
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:52,037
Ssangmun-dong.

210
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:55,874
Ssangmun-dong is the town I live in.

211
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,043
My name is Seong Gi-hun.

212
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:00,003
Seong Gi-hun of Ssangmun-dong.

213
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,507
What's your name?

214
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:04,925
Ali.

215
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,094
Ali Abdul.

216
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,804
Which country are you from?

217
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,055
Pakistan.

218
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:11,098
Pakistan?

219
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:12,974
Where is that?

220
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,184
Right above India.

221
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:15,185
That's right.

222
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:16,812
Of course.

223
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,731
This guy here graduated
from Seoul University, Business--

224
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:20,941
I'm Cho Sang-woo.

225
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:32,369
Do I have to say?

226
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:36,540
We're on the same side now.

227
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:40,836
We at least need to know each others'
names to build a bit of trust.

228
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:45,006
Kang Sae-byeok.

229
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,174
Sae-byeok?

230
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,301
That's a nice name.

231
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,512
Doesn't really suit you, though.

232
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,807
Old sir, what's your name?

233
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:57,310
What?

234
00:23:58,562 --> 00:23:59,604
My name?

235
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,236
My…

236
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:12,033
My name is…

237
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,289
Well, it's…

238
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,167
My…

239
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:22,335
My…

240
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:24,629
name is…

241
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,301
Sir, you must've been
very frightened earlier.

242
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:33,597
When I'm really stressed out,
I tend to forget my home address

243
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,724
and resident registration number too.

244
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,352
It'll be okay once you get some rest.

245
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:49,779
Damn it.

246
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:52,324
Are you really a doctor?

247
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:55,952
What if I'm not?

248
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:59,873
You weren't stabbed too deep,
so you should be fine.

249
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:03,752
Once we get out of here,
I'll treat it again at my hospital.

250
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,880
What a pretentious dickhead.

251
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:10,550
Your business obviously went under,
seeing as you're here.

252
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:12,969
I'm going to leave this place…

253
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,514
with that.

254
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,479
Those bastards.

255
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:26,441
They set everything up for us
to kill them. Why'd they stop us?

256
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:30,237
We could've ended this
without playing any games.

257
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,822
If we kill everyone who's left,

258
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,701
won't we just

259
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,079
get to take all that?

260
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:44,668
We'll get another chance
if we survive the next game.

261
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:48,255
Isn't that so, Doc?

262
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,134
It's done.

263
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,721
This is why people say

264
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,140
you need a doctor in your family.

265
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:04,688
We got rid of quite a few.

266
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:09,109
It went from 107 to 80, so did we kill 27?

267
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,404
Right, babe?

268
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:13,446
"Babe"?

269
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:15,657
Is that right?

270
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,492
I don't know about that.

271
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,035
Mister,

272
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:20,912
how old do I look?

273
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:21,955
Forty-nine.

274
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:26,710
I shouldn't have helped you
during the Honeycomb game.

275
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:27,711
Maybe 39?

276
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:29,421
Last chance.

277
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:34,926
Nineteen?

278
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:42,767
You're very witty, babe.

279
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,857
Then, shouldn't I

280
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,358
be rewarded?

281
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,613
I'll think about it in the restroom.

282
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:08,626
I need to take a leak.

283
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:58,176
Babe.

284
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,639
You and that quack are hiding something.

285
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:08,728
There's nothing to hide.

286
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,283
Babe.

287
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:25,161
Will you…

288
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:30,250
really stick with me to the end?

289
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:33,837
Don't you deceive me.

290
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,924
Okay. Trust me.

291
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,303
You and I will get out of here.

292
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:55,692
What's your name, babe?

293
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:00,989
Why do you ask?

294
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,492
I want to know.

295
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,041
Deok-su.

296
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,128
Jang Deok-su.

297
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,067
Deok-su.

298
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:43,198
If you betray me,

299
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,076
I'll kill you.

300
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:54,793
I might die right now

301
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,337
because of you.

302
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:17,398
Everyone, it's now time to go to sleep.

303
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:20,276
Good work today.

304
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:35,667
SHAPES, RANK, MASKED LEADER, GUN MASSACRE,

305
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:40,338
RIOT, ABETTING MURDER, MY BROTHER

306
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,569
Morse code?

307
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:09,909
Number 29.

308
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:34,934
Sir.

309
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:39,147
-Yes?
-Did you stay up all night?

310
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:43,359
I was afraid they might attack again.

311
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:46,070
You must be so tired.

312
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:48,865
I'm fine.

313
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:52,785
You don't get much sleep once you get old.

314
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:57,874
I wasn't much help,

315
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:01,252
so the least I can do is
stand night watch.

316
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:09,093
The third game will begin momentarily.

317
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:13,640
Follow the staff's instructions
and proceed to the game hall.

318
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:15,683
Let me repeat.

319
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,852
The third game will begin momentarily.

320
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:27,779
Starting head count.
Please wait in front of your door.

321
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:34,911
Head count complete.

322
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:53,429
Welcome to your third game.

323
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:56,849
This game will be played as a team.

324
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,604
All players,
please divide into teams of ten people.

325
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:05,900
You have ten minutes, ten minutes.

326
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:09,529
Let me repeat.

327
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:12,240
This game will be played as a team.

328
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:16,619
All players,
please divide into teams of ten people.

329
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:21,207
You have ten minutes, ten minutes.

330
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:25,378
Get guys who look strong.

331
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:26,337
Okay.

332
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:28,840
What about her?

333
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:41,894
If the game is played by teams of ten,

334
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:45,481
maybe it's Tail Tag
or Why Did You Come to My House.

335
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:48,651
If it's Tail Tag, we need to be fast.

336
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:51,779
If it's Why Did You Come to My House,
it's just Rock-Paper-Scissors.

337
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,366
What should we do?

338
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:58,619
We already have an elderly man
and a woman,

339
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:01,330
so we need to find more men.

340
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:06,169
What if they make us play
Elastics or Gonggi?

341
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:07,545
Women are better at those.

342
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:10,715
That's true, but probability-wise,
men are better at most games.

343
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:13,718
We're betting our lives right now.

344
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,220
Which side will it be?

345
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:24,020
We just need five more people.

346
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:26,439
Let's split up and bring one each.

347
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,410
Hide your hand.

348
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,580
It'll make you look weak.

349
00:34:57,678 --> 00:35:00,473
Boss, this guy wants to join us.

350
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:03,851
Hey, go over there and find more guys.

351
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:27,959
Sir. Have you found a team yet?

352
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:32,463
-No.
-Then you should join us. We have a team.

353
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,340
The thing is,

354
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:37,969
I have to stick with my wife.

355
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,180
Is that all right?

356
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:43,224
I'm sorry.

357
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,309
We already have many women on our team.

358
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:52,942
Excuse me. If you're looking
for a team, let's join up.

359
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:02,285
Excuse me.

360
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:05,496
If you don't have a team yet,

361
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,790
do you want to join us?

362
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,347
Let's team up next time.

363
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:24,432
Babe.

364
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:28,895
No way. You're joking with me, right?

365
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:31,522
My team is already full. Can't you see?

366
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:34,150
We have exactly ten people.

367
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:39,363
Babe, don't be like that.

368
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:42,491
I'm sorry.

369
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:43,701
I'll be better.

370
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:46,120
Babe, I'll do anything.

371
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,414
I'm good at everything.
You know that, babe.

372
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:49,832
So…

373
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,169
let's split up just for this game

374
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:55,880
then meet again for the next one,
all right?

375
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:57,882
Babe.

376
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:00,343
Why should we split up?

377
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:03,721
You said we'd stick together to the end.

378
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:05,556
Babe.

379
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:07,934
Can you really do without me?

380
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:11,604
I can't do this without you, Babe.

381
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:13,064
Get off!

382
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:16,651
God damn it. You're so damn clingy.

383
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:19,570
Stop calling me babe.

384
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:22,240
If you call me that again,
I'll rip that mouth off.

385
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:35,002
Asshole.

386
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:38,005
Are you finally showing your true colors?

387
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:41,634
Jang Deok-su.

388
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:44,136
You scumbag.

389
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:48,432
I told you that I'll kill you
if you betray me.

390
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,101
I'm so scared.

391
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:51,519
Ms. Han Mi-nyeo.

392
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,897
Good luck with your game today, okay?

393
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:00,987
She's not worth the effort.

394
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:07,034
What?

395
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:08,577
Join me.

396
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,209
One.

397
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:17,837
Two.

398
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:19,171
Three.

399
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,257
Four.

400
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,427
Five.

401
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,511
Six.

402
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:27,054
Seven.

403
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:29,098
Eight.

404
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:32,476
Nine?

405
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:36,147
Wait, is there someone
who couldn't bring anyone?

406
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,398
I'm sorry.

407
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,029
Who brought you here?

408
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:45,197
This one.

409
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:49,618
I told you that we're only getting men.

410
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:52,413
Things seem pretty grim here.

411
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:54,749
Did I join the wrong team?

412
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,625
Then I'll see myself out.

413
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:57,752
Wait.

414
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:00,796
Just sit there.

415
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:05,009
We don't even know
what we're going to play next.

416
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,553
We don't have much time either.

417
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:11,140
Let's find one more person
and make it ten first.

418
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:13,559
Who would volunteer
to join this weak team?

419
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,520
Once everyone finds a team,

420
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,189
we'll end up with someone left out.

421
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:21,233
I didn't get left out.

422
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:23,652
Boys, I'll give you
a special chance to join me.

423
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:26,572
You boys are very lucky today. My gosh.

424
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:29,617
I'd be much more useful
than these scrawny girls.

425
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:33,329
On top of that, I'm good at everything
except for the things I'm not.

426
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:39,835
The time for deciding teams is over.

427
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:44,673
All teams, form a line
at the entrance of the game hall.

428
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:45,591
Wait.

429
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:47,635
We aren't playing here?

430
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:25,756
Welcome to the third game.

431
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:29,301
You're going to play Tug-of-War.

432
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:33,055
You will pull a rope on that tower

433
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:36,642
to drop your opponents down below to win.

434
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:50,531
Now, I will draw lots
to decide which teams will play first.

435
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:54,034
Everyone, please sit down.

436
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:03,252
I will draw the lot
for the team on the left tower.

437
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:09,467
Team One. Please stand up.

438
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:17,641
Next, I will draw the lot
for the team on the right tower.

439
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:23,564
Team Seven. Please stand up.

440
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:35,284
Team One and Seven will play first.

441
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:39,830
Team One and Seven,
please enter the towers.

442
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:41,600
Kill them!

443
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,534
Die!

444
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:43,746
Eliminated players are No. 245,

445
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:48,250
No. 120, No. 37, No. 408,

446
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:53,005
No. 27, No. 273, No. 58,

447
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:59,386
No. 243, No. 327, and No. 241.

448
00:44:36,131 --> 00:44:38,884
I will draw lots for the next round.

449
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:39,927
Team Four.

450
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:46,100
Team Five.

451
00:44:58,487 --> 00:44:59,988
Shit.

452
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:01,990
It's a sausage fest.

453
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:05,077
Team Four and Team Five,
please enter the towers.

454
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:15,212
What a shame.
I wanted to kill you guys myself.

455
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:04,052
Don't be so dispirited.

456
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:09,057
Tug-of-War isn't really about strength.

457
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:12,436
Then what? Can we win by talking?

458
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:17,191
In Tug-of-War, with a good strategy
and good teamwork,

459
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:20,360
you can win even if your team is weaker.

460
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,488
The only one who can save us now

461
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:24,281
is the Lord.

462
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:26,492
You're barely standing, old man.

463
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:28,785
Stop talking nonsense
and save your strength.

464
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:32,706
Let's hear him out at least.

465
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:40,881
I played my share of Tug-of-War
in my hometown when I was young,

466
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:44,051
and I rarely ever lost.

467
00:46:45,093 --> 00:46:49,765
Even when there was a ssireum athlete
on the other team,

468
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:52,601
putting the odds very much against us.

469
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:57,147
Listen closely,

470
00:46:57,231 --> 00:47:03,487
and I'll tell you how I beat them
back in the day.

471
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:11,119
First off, the leader is very important.

472
00:47:11,828 --> 00:47:17,668
That person is closest
to the leader of the opposition,

473
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:23,298
and the rest of the team
looks at the back of their leader.

474
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:27,803
If the leader seems weak or dispirited,

475
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:31,014
then the game is already over.

476
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:35,018
Then at the end of the rope,

477
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:39,898
you'll need someone dependable
like the anchor of a ship,

478
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:45,404
Placing people is also important.

479
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:52,160
Place the rope in the middle,
and people go on alternating sides.

480
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:58,917
Place your two feet straight forward,

481
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:02,838
and stick the rope between your armpits.

482
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:06,592
That way, you can put in
all of your strength.

483
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:12,055
And lastly,
this is the most important thing.

484
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:16,143
When the game starts,
for the first ten seconds

485
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:19,146
you just have to hold out.

486
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:23,275
You should practically lie down.

487
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:27,112
Push your lower abdomen up to the sky,

488
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:29,781
and push your head back to the point

489
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:33,452
you can see the groin
of the person behind you.

490
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:38,206
If you do that, the other team
won't be able to pull us to their side.

491
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:41,585
Hold out for just ten seconds like that.

492
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:47,966
Then the opposition will get flustered
thinking, "Why won't they even budge?"

493
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:52,304
Because they would have believed
that they were much stronger.

494
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:54,723
If you can hold out for that long,

495
00:48:54,806 --> 00:49:01,355
there will be a moment
when the opponents' rhythm breaks.

496
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:04,983
Pull!

497
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:29,257
Pull yourselves together!

498
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:58,286
Do something! God damn it!

499
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,794
Pull yourselves together and listen up!

500
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:08,797
When I give the sign,
just take three steps forward!

501
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,633
Go forward? Are you crazy?

502
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:13,760
We have to make them trip!

503
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,303
That's bullshit!

504
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:16,805
Let's give it a shot!

505
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:18,557
No, I can't do it!

506
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,392
If you can't, you'll die!

507
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:22,728
On the count of three! One!

508
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:23,854
Two!

509
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:25,230
Three!

510
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:26,745
